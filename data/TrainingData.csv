ive always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we as humans seem to sort things it seems like were much more efficient than many of the algorithms at least the ones ive seen which is admittedly few for example when we look at all the items we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once eg oh i remember that was the smallest before i found the actual smallest so thats the second smallest let me put both of them first and second right now saving myself a relook i know computers are still faster in the end but i suspect thats because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data and possibly our brain has a slower clock speed rather than computational efficiency anyone know if thats true has anyone made a human sort algorithm so to speak that sorts the way we do including our little tricks im guessing no if not are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two like the one i just described,positive

imo whats most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly theyre hoping to get out of these deals everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money but then what i have to wonder is if gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios then why wouldnt they turn down ps in theory gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties weve also seen plenty of evidence that xbox is swimming in microsoft money so they should easily have the means to outbid sony for games they want on their service as well as typical console exclusives for that matter yet we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to sonys deals and stipulations if a studio wanted to join gp and told sony they would decline their gp restriction contract i can see them getting less marketing on ps but i highly doubt sony wouldnt want their sales cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with sony but i dont know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line it just seems to me like somehow many studios arent jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it that or gp isnt as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think no shade at gp i love it just saying i dont get how ms would be losing out to sonys contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place,positive

summary notes 0000 intro the problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information the second brain system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information the second brain system has helped ali in his own life and can hopefully help others as well the second brain system uses code as an acronym to explain its core foundations capture organize distill express 0041 what is a second brain and why should you have one a second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas building a second brain can help you express your creativity be more productive and make better decisions every job today involves knowledge work of some kind and a second brain can help you with inputting processing and outputting information the methodology for building a second brain has four parts capture organize distill and express code 0456 c capture ali discusses different ways of capturing information both manually and automatically ali captures his thoughts and ideas in apple notes he also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books articles and podcasts having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day as well as highlights from books articles and podcasts 0832 o organise ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in ones learning this means that when you come across something relevant you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take rather than creating a new category for it you can still search for specific information using control f or command f if needed this system is especially helpful when working on longterm projects with many moving parts 1107 d distill ali talks about a method called progressive summarization which is basically like highlighting but on steroids this is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important different than highlighting were used to in school its not particularly effective for retention in your own personal brain but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important 1145 e express the e in the second brain system stands for express meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas you need to share them with the world in some way sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback collaborate with others and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work without expressing our ideas they are essentially useless its important to find a way to share your creativity with others 1309 how my second brain has helped ali the coursebook has helped ali become more productive but also more creative and less stressed in general the system taught ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one most of the work is already done the system has also helped with his teaching work he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information,positive

seneca suggested to his friends that instead of reading ever more widely we ought to focus on the works and authors that really inspire us most readers dont do this so their thinking tends to be dominated by the last few things theyve read and they end up struggling with all these conflicting truths living inside them seneca thought our time was better spent developing a deep understanding of ideas that are truly important to us rather than surveying a wide range of opinions without deep contemplation and reflection and in addition to the chance to read a book with a different purpose rereading is worthwhile because while the book stays the same if you pick it up again after a few years youre a different person and that allows you to see it in a new way,neutral

truly inspiring video the presentation is truly flawless and the few frames of minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game i love how you used pocket edition because its unique and different than most minecraft videos being published today using pc or console versions of the game and i really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles i really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding if you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay we can find that the player is holding a torch just like the many around his shelter this means the torches around the base has just been placed and shows how you can move forward in life no matter how dire the situation may seem in the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning showing how even if someone is in their home they are never safe of the dangers outside and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety i also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls not to mention the way the player looks out the exit as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there and how even though you may be small compared to the universe the impact you make can change the world another very symbolic part of this film is the ending where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the players dedication it also is in a slightly smaller frame and black bars replace the outer edges which show that even though you try your best there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey and how much different it could have been if you have done something different which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of minecraft as long as possible without itching ones testicles the background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt blue or sad about ending but still proud of what they accomplished and is hopeful for what is to come a really poetic performance really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls i cant wait to see more work from you 1010 simply phenomenal,positive

okay this gonna be a long one sorry about that im french and theres an interesting fact about france its that we are brutally honest most other people dont like that so we are called arrogant rude obnoxious but we are not we are just honest and people dont like honesty when we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other its not because we cheat more than you its just because we honestly answered the questions youre probably wondering where im going with that well i was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other not staying friends with each other yadayadayada and i cant relate at all because it doesnt work like that here i still know a lot of female who were already friend in high school and im 40 whenever i see my mother or my girlfriend or my girl friends they are just friendly i dunno its probably only on screen but the number of time i saw in tv shows or movies a group of girls being friendly then as soon as one leave they all turn to bitch on this one thats something i never saw in france they bitch on her while she is here and she doesnt take it badly because she does the same so i was wondering why is that why are they still friends if its different for others then i realized because we are honest my female friends wont hesitate to look at each others and say wow girl you look like shit today didnt you put on weight recently maybe you should work out and for me thats a healthy relationship why does american males manage to stay friends because they trash talk each other because they are honest because they say things as they are yeah sometimes we have fallouts but we mend things why cant female american stay friends because they are sneaky they lie ooooh you look gorgeous girl you are so strong i envy you while not thinking any of that sooner or later in any relationship based on lie the truth will come out and its not going to be pretty,negative

i have ptsd and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts it is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened you keep thinking about the event and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened to get it to stop replaying in your head this can be at all different levels from avoiding certain types of people to avoiding groups public transportation or in some cases avoiding people altogether violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations but most people with ptsd arent violent if anything most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation i guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts the idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth at least ive never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that you dont have real flashbacks like hallucinations you just can not stop thinking about what happened why it happened how you could have stopped it and etc like anyone in a traumatic event issue is usually it goes away after a bit where in ptsd you still keep dwelling on it years later,negative

hello how are you from my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic however if you want to reach an even wider audience considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak english i suggest 1 to associate the subtitles even if in english as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery 2 that the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language thanks for the attention thanks for the video and i wish all success to the simplilearn team,positive

personally i think education or specifically a lack thereof is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this because ignorance breeds fear and distrust especially in things that are new or foreign when i was in elementary school back in the 70s i was reading my way through my schools scifi section it was just a few shelves but it had almost all the classics asimov bova bradbury campbell clarke doc smith heinlein and then i got to verne id just finished up 30000 leagues and was getting into journey to the center of the earth when i found a page had been ripped from the book being a good student i reported it to the librarian but instead of focusing on the missing page she was outraged that i was reading this particular book it was above my level she said and too difficult for me this was a hundredyearold story at this point and i was pretty sure it wasnt a difficult one to follow the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on creature feature on saturdays but she still took the book away and over the next few weeks that scifi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there a short time later i overheard her talking to another teacher about of all things a shooting star a meteor that many had seen a night or two before the librarian was mocking the teacher because a shooting star is impossible the heavens are permanent the stars dont move as the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor it seemed to both terrify and outrage her and the longer that conversation went on the more even i maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time realized the scifi books she had removed werent above my level they were above her level she had no understanding of science and all these scifi stories about starships robots and alien worlds were things that she just didnt understand and because of that they scared her so she locked them away and unfortunately it sounds like that sort of mindset hasnt changed all that much in the 40 or so years since then,negative

the reason they said large and open space instead of largest map is because if you look at their past games and you measure the square footages of every location and put them together that may be bigger none of their past games have had an open world their other games usually have one big world segmented into multiple locations in this game its actually one open world so its the largest open space of any game they created and they did say that this open world is bigger than prey,neutral

summary machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data there are lots of different ways algorithms that machines can learn the algorithms can be grouped into supervised unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be inputoutput pairs or just inputs supervised learning algorithms require inputoutput pairs ie they require the output unsupervised learning requires only the input data not the outputs here is how in general supervised algorithms work you feed it an example input then the associated output you repeat the above step many many times eventually the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs now you can feed it a brand new input and it will predict the output for you here is how in general unsupervised algorithms work you feed it an example input without the associated output you repeat the above step many times eventually the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups now you can feed it a brand new input and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with the first example in this video used the knearest neighbor algorithm which is a supervised machine learning algorithm hope that was useful to someone thanks for the video really enjoyed it,neutral

i agree to some points but disagree to some i dont think studying data science and knowledge gained will be worthless in 510 years the core statistics and maths learned in the degree will be useful decades to come yes some aspects of tech stack will change but the same thing happens in other computer science fields as well the data science is very broad field and if one does degree in this field they can transfer those skills into multitude of other fields and can create value for the company and lastly career trajectory in this field is still not fixed as this is nascent field and we dont know how things will pan out in 1020 years down the line,neutral

as someone who studies convict leasing in tennessee this is a great video just a couple corrections 1 tennessee prisoners were not sent to birmingham they were leased to tennessee coal and railroad company its a little more complicated than that but we can go with that for simplicitys sake who used prisoners in their mines in tennessee after convict leasing ended in tennessee in 1896 tennessee coal and railroad moved its headquarters to birmingham and continued using forced prison labor there but those were alabama prisoners not tennessee prisoners 2 states absolutely used convict leasing to make money the lease on the tennessee state penitentiary could not be sold for less than 100000 per year beginning in the mid1880s that would be over 2 million per year in todays money 3 selling crops after sunset was specifically illegal as a means of controlling sharecroppers the idea was that sharecroppers might sell some of their crop outside of their contract with the landowner they would need to do it secretly so that the landowner didnt know and would probably do it at night to prevent witnesses hence why selling crops after sunset was illegal i am happy to provide archival documents for these facts if you are interested,neutral

i must say that you are the most erudite and smart analyst in the crypto space first of all youre just awesome ive been following for months now and the cinematic videos excellent insight and comedic tone are outstanding before anything else i would like to say that no one can exactly predict in days how long a bear or bull market could last or how low and high the prices can go but we can try to make predictions using past events i think prices should run up a lot now punishing panic sellers and forced sellers most new traders struggle at first to make sense of the markets and how to put their portfolios in a position to flourish many try to start on their own and quickly end up with a string of losses slowly seeing their accounts dwindle to what they started off as everyone is looking at the bitcoin price action from a 2021 bull run perspective everything has changed…we are in a recession facing stagflation rising rates and energy shortages driving food and living costs through the roof breaking consumers’ backs there are different strategies to profit from the crypto market but holding and waiting for a major pump is not the best way to earn profits off the market smart investors trade and take shortterm profits ive made over 11’ btc with 21’ btc retail trading not on my own but with the help of a professional who has reputable background and understanding of the market kyle miller i came across his channel where he shares his charts the selling fatigue will wane and the market will reset historically fortune favored the ones who bought in thought moments in moments of uncertainty when prices traded close to the 200wmayou can reach mr kyle on ͳeiєɠɾαm kylemiller3 cheers thank me later,positive

very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity but even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period most paints contained extremely high levels of lead many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes most pencils had a high lead concentration hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil house roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water i could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile solder usually 6040 lead tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment so you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels to blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view,negative

a good video as always as a cs major myself this is actually finally a series where i can answer questions and stuff in the comment section just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info 1 there are also not versions of all the gates and or and xor become nand nor xnor respectively they are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate while they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts you often here people verbally nand and xnor when talking about logic so i think it is interesting to note even though this isnt computer engineering 2 while by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false this is often not the case when we actually look at real components because of power usage the opposite is often used generally the more common output is set to 0 3 0 doesnt actually mean nothing is flowing through for example we may set our 1 to 5 volts and our 0 to 23 volts this allows for us to have an off state at 0 volts we wouldnt want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off there are also other uses for this state but this may be covered in a future video,positive

 these are some most important and precious advices every one should read  1 take risks in your life if you win you can lead if you lose you can guide 2 people are not what they say but what they do so judge them not from their words but from their actions 3 when someone hurts you dont feel bad because its a law of nature that the tree that bears the sweetest fruits gets maximum number of stones 4 take whatever you can from your life because when life starts taking from you it takes even your last breath 5 in this world people will always throw stones on the path of your success it depends on what you make from them a wall or a bridge 6 challenges make life interesting overcoming them make life meaningful 7 there is no joy in victory without running the risk of defeat 8 a path without obstacles leads nowhere 9 past is a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay 10 you cant have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time 11 if what you did yesterday still looks big to you then you havent done much today 12 if you dont build your dreams someone else will hire you to build theirs 13 if you dont climb the mountain you cant view the plain 14 dont leave it idle use your brain 15 you are not paid for having brain you are only rewarded for using it intelligently 16 it is not what you dont have that limits you it is what you have but dont know how to use 17 what you fail to learn might teach you a lesson 18 the difference between a corrupt person and an honest person is the corrupt person has a price while the honest person has a value 19 if you succeed in cheating someone dont think that the person is a fool realize that the person trusted you much more than you deserved i 20 honesty is an expensive gift dont expect it from cheap people i hope you have learnt something you can recieve more from my this channel,positive

how to solve the rubiks cube faster ► please read this before commenting i try to reply often but i dont get step x or it doesnt work is too unspecific and i cant help unless i know exactly what problem you have make sure you know the 4 moves 152 has the 4 moves and you have to be able to do this to understand what 4 moves means when i use it again later on common first layer problems step 1 2 if the side colors of the cross or first layer dont line up the way i showed it in the video then you need to redo it pay attention to all of the colors on one piece and dont just pick white pieces randomly i talk about this in the video how im trying to match the other colors of the white piece like whiteorange etc taking pieces out of the second layer step 3 at 533 i say you should already know how to do this i admit this is unclear you should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer if this does not make sense watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment common top layer problems step 4 if you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 5 there should be no problems here step 6 if you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 7 finish the 4 moves dont stop at 3 every time turn the bottom dont rotate the whole cube to get the next piece if it still does not work you need to reassemble the cube as solved why do i need to reassemble the cube randomly assembling the cube only has a 112 chance of being solvable if youve ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces then that can be the problem if stickers have been switched you will have to switch them back full example solve,negative

my biggest tip if youre a computer science student and have the chance it was not required at my college to take software engineering make sure you take all the software engineering classes you can because thats what youll be doing most of cs is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies agile which is just old school rad with more crap to have to deal with waterfall spiral etc etc will give you a better idea of what youll be doing on the day to day youll tailor your data structure and algorithm knowledge to what youre tasked with at work but the software engineering portion youll use anywhere you go,neutral

i dont think that dickens shortcomings as a husband and parent were a result of the difficulty of being great at two things at the same time but rather is an example of how difficult it is to overcome the emotional spiritual and psychic damages inflicted by an unhappy childhood while he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art quite an achievement he wasnt able to heal emotionally its usually easier to deal with such things in abstract intellectual and artistic ways he was in many ways driven by his demons and that can surprisingly take you very far in life but it doesnt make you a better person in fact the success may militate against real change,negative

just wanna real quick say that if you plan on being really good at building this is not the only tutorial you need not even remotely being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics ie what they are and how to execute them you need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter often times even understand things like color theory there is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video especially an 8 minute one but as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it also if you want to get really into building i would recommend watching all of grians tutorials and once youve gotten to a decently advanced level watching tutorials from another far smaller youtuber who goes by horace minecraft he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft in my opinion even better than grian is though they do build in vastly different ways so there isnt much comparison that works there,neutral

ai is the most important one a lot of people think ai is going to somehow mean self awareness consciousness at some point the main implications of ai is that it is self improving the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen is that ai is going to overtake humans in a lot of things including research and science it is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change everything about life far more than the industrial era did for example 300 years from now we can have an ai program that has been improving itself for 300 years we lose about 14 million people each year from car accidents and that is just fatalities there are also many more injuries so while i understand people being skeptical about machines driving cars as time goes on it is not even going to be close ai is going to be able to do many many things better than humans at some point these quantum computers are going to make ai they could program an ai to make a better ai of itself an improved version then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it etc etc there is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens,neutral

everybody you can take any variety of quinoa from the store meant to be cooked and plant the seeds i have done this in california many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa it takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach the next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains you can even grow it as a houseplant but beware it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy if you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in it likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt crumbled rock and sand in a very hot place where its occasionally watered thats what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun it would be a cool school science project to do with kids the stuff is like a weed and grows in conditions other food sources do not,neutral

i worked as a high school teacher for thirty years over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory learning style was just one of many nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories presented as facts demanding evidence and proof ever yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher so you had no choice at least whilst being observed i became quite cynical in the end because i realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their cv and each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one god forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience education and intelligence,negative

a decisive battle between civilization and savagery has begun even in the second world war it was not like that because the two savages were on different sides of the front it was an intergerman showdown the germanoslavic ethnic of the deutschs against the germanoceltic french and the english and the russian savagery was either together with the savagery of the deutschs or against them now the front line has clearly been drawn between civilization and savagery i see the philosophical law of contradiction civilization is definitely a positive phenomenon but it is mixed with negativity in the form of shame and cowardice civilization has hid behind ukraine and is waiting for something unknown the memory of civilizations victory in this war will be tainted with the memory of shame,neutral

my underestanding is that the wife wasnt going to survive either way so it was a matter of letting the gods take them both or actively killing his wife to save the baby an absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it weve seen some horrible stuff but her death scene was up there with one of ramsays scenes i also think given recent political events in the us it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from marvel not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come also i hear this series will be far more morally grey than game of thrones ever was daemon gives me ramsay or joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous while he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like joffrey or ramsay so i picture him being closer to a cerseijaime style character but if anything he absolutely gives peak targaryen vibes and matt smith gives a stellar performance im really excited to see corlys valaryon and rhaenys targaryen a shame we havent seen much of rhaenys but i picture her having some of cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown i hate to touch on this but i know corlyss racial change was of concern and i originally had slight concern myself not because some omg woke bs but because of the velaryons and the targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so i prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one but if you think about it the light complexion of the targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins furthermore valyria was awfully close to the summer isles and sothoryos so to me corlys is more what i would envision the original valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest especially after seeing him on screen he seems like a great character already and i think and hope hes up there with davos otto hightower gives strong tywin and littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all he does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways and then obviously viserys is the ned stark of the series i love seeing that name reclaimed and while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity im glad he apologized to rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her i especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with only out of precedent and tradition its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a woman maybe rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had also while the age difference between him and alicent is a little insane and i dont like otto pimping out his daughter like that i do think they would legitimately treat each other well probably erring on the side of viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into s3 or s4 of game of thrones,negative

ive been an edtech consultant in beijing for 7 years ive also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools there are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive the first and foremost factor i would note is the lack of public discourse this permeates through every part of society especially education if you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner inquiry and reflection in education this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge even in history class theres no critical thinking or reflection involved it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember the second factor of note is barriers of information the public does not have easy access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content and even if they did get access they wouldnt be able to recognize it on top of that there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as vipkids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations this causes market distortion and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name eg wonders and say thats their curriculum without any plan how to implement it the third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge as stated in the first point most of the populations education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection if youve been taught not to question things your whole life how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies how can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences the result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good or fishing consultants like me for free content the fourth factor is lack of foreign talent there are not enough qualified teachers to meet demand the general population would not be able to recognize one either many companies hire russians call them american and slap a 200 markup on the course its up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content instruction and meet the unrealistic expectations the decision makers sales people set for the parents the final factor is who the decision makers are who decides what national curriculum is starting in 2020 private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the national curriculum this topdown decision making only exasperates the situation it also permeates throughout the society ive been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools most of these decision makers are unqualified theyre sales people at best i should also mention that many parents have no clue about education yet influence the schools with their misconceptionsbut this is not the parents fault rather its the schools fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program as for price its simply about demand vs supply lack of foreign talent as mentioned before combined with a desperate middle class and higher trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost they will pay upwards of 200k rmb just to make it happen for their little middle schooler unfortunately i exited the market partially because the clients i had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problemsmostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum,negative

thanks for the great content shane as a data scientist myself who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially given that my own engineering field had few jobs available one thing i have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route if you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline plus the skills you need as a data scientist you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot while traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth you end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do but without the specialized domain knowledge coming from an engineering discipline myself i was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways i have noticed the same with my other peers who also dont come from the traditional route i say this because i have met with a lot of nontraditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they cant break through they definitely can break through and thrive in this field they offer specialized insights you cant get through the traditional route so if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities like linguistics or english you can become a powerful data scientist with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied such as nlp if you are someone who comes from a stem field even better because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems all data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science but what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem address user needs and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model i dont mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off but i do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well,positive

ive had both iphone and android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iphone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest ios on every device the only company that can use ios is also apple so theres not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which android device is best additionally apple may be late to the party with certain things but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know its going to work significantly better than the competition apple may be more costly but id rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway,positive

just a few things to note about the bigoh notation discussed in this episode in industry bigoh notation alone is what is seen when discussing algorithms however in academia it is a bit more in depth on is instead used to represent an upperbound in the worst case what is this problem or algorithm ωn pronounced bigomega is used to represent the lowerbound in the best case what is this problem or algorithm θn prounounced theta without the big is used to represent the tightbound used when the bigoh is equal to the bigomega which is the exact running time there is also small omega and small o but those are rarely used also we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation so if a problem takes 5n4 3n2 1 to do we just say it is θn4 we drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big you may notice that earlier i mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation this is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem for example for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix we have ωn2 since we know that we at least need to read in n2 values this problem currently has on23728639 which is the running time of an algorithm created by francois le gall in 2014,neutral

the first thing i want you to knowwhom ever you might be is that god loves you i dont care what you have done in the past i dont care of the mistakes you have made the blunders we all have he loves you i want you to understand that millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn in just a few moments time if you believe it is all god requires believe it forget about your past when they put jesus in that tomb they put all of your sins in that tomb as well when jesus walked out of that tomb he walked out victorious and we came out with him a new creation in christ jesus i am going to pray and i want you to pray with me i am going to say the words that you need to say saying words cannot save you but if you truly believe in your heart you will be saved and i want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart and jesus christ will come into your heart and change your heart and change your life let us pray dear god in heaven i come to you i am sorry for my sins and the way i have lived the things i have done please forgive me cleanse me with your precious blood from every sin i have ever committed right now with my mouth i confess the lord jesus and in my heart i believe that jesus died for me and rose from the dead and i accept jesus christ this very moment as my savior my redeemer and i make him the lord of my life and right now i am a new creation i am washed i am cleansed i am saved we ask this all in the name of jesus amen,positive

this thing is also evident in india students preparing for neetjee and for many other competitive exams who pay lakhs of fees in coaching institutes get a remarkable edge over the students who cant afford to go to these coachings most of the teachers teaching at these institutes are iitians doctors etc these coachings provide great facilities to their students so the results are obvious there are very few government colleges of class 11 and 12 in india who actually prepare their students for these competitive exams also what i have noticed is that its not just the school that you go to matters but also the kind of peer group which you have also the support and thinking of your parents and the overall society and environment in which live matters when it comes to education,positive

first of all let me clear up the misunderstanding about why asians do well in life we do not always send kids off to academic supplements sat study classes etc obviously there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go but there are a plethora that do just as well if not better on these types of activities sat act gpa school etc without any additional help aside from a practise test book from the local library that is me and i can affirm that for many asian kids we have an inherent need to do good make our parents proud no matter how much pressure we have and have a highlevel job and go to ivy league schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us we push for the best because of our work ethic not because all asians have oh so much money for the majority of our parents as immigrants it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour the hard work the exhaustion and the prejudice they have faced in the past all to provide their children with more opportunities it is not that asians are inherently smarter or richer or more privileged in any ways although there are those select few but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today asians are no different from others of ethnic origin to say mexicans africanamericans indians and other disprivileged minorities in the states the only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end i am not trying to start up any racial slurs cursing or insultations of any kind just putting out a thought and consideration for you all obviously there are many successful talented and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones but i am just making a point here why would the highlevel universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of racial preference or racial advantage note i put that in quotations meaning i myself do not think that is a fact there are hardworking and lazy people smart and ignorant good and bad in any race it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public so tell me why should one race get more sympathy or preference over another can we not just all be equal human beings it is like saying red is better than pink why oh because it is true without an explanation so what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade chinese girl and i wanted to share the truth to everyone thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully we can all start changing society little by little with messages like this no enmities i hope,positive

my theory here that plant creature could possibly be that fungus but in a more mutated form as seen previously in the missing persons and autopsy report videos whenever someone dies in the backrooms they get covered in this black coloured fungus this fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto mutating itself onto the dead body given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate 100 1000 or even millions of years at best and also given that how time passes strangely in the backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the informational video with the date 291990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished however it wasnt teleportation but instead time travel that researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the presentation video with the date 581990 when the alarm rang out and cctv footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by async so by this logic the whenever someone dies in the backrooms the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time the creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash as seen in kanes secret video of 9780415263573 this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed the driver wasnt able to push the brakes in time to stop the car thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage the driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there the fungus grew on him and later the entire room in its mutated form also it sounded like the creature was yelling out help in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room which was seen in the original found footage video and later the pitfalls video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of its last victims and in this case even its originator which is the driver its all just a theory which i just came up with dont take it canon lol,negative

the sorrows of young werther is a fabulous book despite the tragicromantic style it is not only based on goethes own disappointing experiences with women but also based on a friend who committed suicide after a woman he was in love with rejected him im no expert on goethe but i also understand he completed the colour wheel which isaac newton started it is important to understand that in goethes time there was a romantic movement nothing to do with the definition of the word today but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late 18th c called sturm und drang storm and stress a small group including schiller of angry young men who embraced the ideals of the romantic movement by the way if you havent done a video on the romantic movement please do the romantics embraced much of the opposite of what they saw in the enlightenment such as science and rationalism and its clinical dry detached way of categorising humanity and the world the romantics were not an organised group as such one of the best descriptions of the romantics was written by my old philosophy teacher the declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of culture and rationality which barred the way both historically and personally to a return to nature this is nature the unbounded wild and everchanging nature the sublime and powerful were humans to behave naturally freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed and humans could live a nobler life in the name of nature the romantics worshipped liberty power love violence imagination irrationality the greeks the primitives or anything that aroused their emotional responses while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves,neutral

ive never understood why apple does this they send earlyaccess devices to handpicked channels that almost always give positive reviews but just 12 hours later the products are released to the public anyway and the blacklisted channels upload teardown videos or showcase major issuesnegative things etc i really wish apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want from a consumers point of view i dont trust reviews from those who get the early access products they clearly fit into apples agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place anyway sucks that this happened to you i remember watching apple content on this channel way back in the early 2010s although as you said in the video its likely a blessing in disguise because you can say whatever you want about apple now,negative

the biggest thing ive realized lately is that the more money you have the more money you will want to spend so you never really feel like you have enough thats why i really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have this is especially true of us in the first world we get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff that they are living the dream but the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles and if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach the irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most they have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need so when they come to live here and get a job they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money but the family doesnt realize that the cost of living is much higher where we live you never feel like you have enough,positive

this lecture is awesome and really inspiring ive been a fan now for years now lex and im really happy to see your success i just wanted to point out that i believe your analysis of one shot learning re human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base the learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling sitting up and standing up this process takes usually between 1 and 2 years this time and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible the process can be accelerated through coordinationspecific training on the part of the parents which occurs quite often errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road eg requiring knee replacement at 55 bipedalism is pretty complex and is way harder than quadrupedalism which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim,positive

yes this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding for anyone thats getting deeper into learning web dev stuff i highly recommend scrimba it has a great problemsolving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what youve learned together instead of just showing you the solution first theres also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloudbased coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so its very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor you can pause it at any time and directly edit the code thats being written during the tutorial,positive

dr peterson there is another physicist turned philosopher who wrote a lot about the nature of the mind and of consciousness basing himself in his understanding of physics his name was david bohm he is now deceased but he wrote a book called wholeness and the implicate order in which he discusses several things which might be relevant to this conversation and which i found very enlightening i recommend it to you and while youre at it you might as well also look into his interpretation of quantum mechanics called bohmian mechanics since you showed interest in quantum theory his interpretation gets rid of the inconsistencyincompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way and in a way which takes all of the apparent magic out of the theory i was fascinated to see that roger penrose uses godel incompleteness to support his views on the nature of consciousness since i came to the same conclusions on my own years ago based on the same mathematics so cool to hear my ideas coming from the mouth of such a brilliant man,positive

some of my favorite voltaire quotes this man was a genius being a bird aint all about flying and shitting from high places it requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mothers womb and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear it has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure it would need eternity to learn something about his soul it takes an instant to kill him of all religions the christian should of course inspire the most tolerance but until now christians have been the most intolerant of all men religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool uncertainty is an uncomfortable position but certainty is an absurd one if you have two religions in your land the two will cut each other’s throats but if you have thirty religions they will dwell in peace what can you say to a man who tells you he prefers obeying god rather than men and that as a result hes certain hell go to heaven if he cuts your throat behind every successful man stands a surprised motherinlaw it is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge animals have these advantages over man they never hear the clock strike they die without any idea of death they have no theologians to instruct them their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome and unpleasant ceremonies their funerals cost them nothing and no one starts lawsuits over their wills the human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the welltrodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road every man is a creature of the age in which he lives and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time despite the enormous quantity of books how few people read and if one reads profitably one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day i have wanted to kill myself a hundred times but somehow i am still in love with life this ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our more stupid melancholy propensities for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away to loathe one’s very being and yet to hold it fast to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities the more i read the more i acquire the more certain i am that i know nothing it is forbidden to kill therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets god is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh,neutral

i love your channel the technical details are perfect i’m an engineer and i work with batteries as a hobby there are two kinds of batteries that are lion one is “protected” and the other is “unprotected” the protected ones prevent overcharging and overdischarging as well as over current the unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection guess which people choose for their vaping lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density they are damaged by over charging and over discharging cheap chargers don’t behave and will over charge few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge so why don’t people use protected cells generally those have too low current to make vaping possible the current draw to instantly heat to 200c is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in causing things to not work or work much more slowly,positive

unfortunately google has no clue how to measure helpful i can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top the economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled google could simply remove the top n content farms to improve search results look at the fake diy and cooking sites on youtube google could push them to the bottom yet they are often pushed to the top content farms have high production value and low value content but users will go first for slick looking and the kicker google generates revenue from ads on those pages put simply incentives are not aligned for google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content edit not sure not having to go to an additional site is a very good metric apply that idea to getting a mortgage getting medical advice hiring a contractor if someone tells me fertilzer xyz is best for my tomatoes you know what im going to do,negative

yes there’s ambiguity in role definitions in my previous company i worked as data scientist however i hardly did any data science work it was more like a developer work where i was assigned to test and deploy the ml models in production i could learn a lot about aws cloud architecture and services trouble shoot real time issues but did little of ml then i changed my job and joined as data analyst here i do little of analysis sql etc and more of ml like developing models and fine tuning them cleaning the data feature engineering and feature selection i would caution the people aspiring to enter the field because many a times companies themselves are not sure where and how they are going to use data science what are the prerequisites for a successful data science project they lack quality data if they do have data accessing and compiling the data is another issue after aligning with multiple departments as single man army you are expected to give some magical results when results are satisfactory you will be asked to deploy them here again the streamlined organisational requirements are missing somehow you drag the project later you are expected to monitor and troubleshoot issues in production and then after all of this single man army efforts management doesn’t see any value in it just to keep up with trend companies end up hiring a data scientist and expect that person to assume multiple roles and give them an end to end solution they are just giving analytics a try without investing much in it,neutral

apologies for not watching the whole video as a former student and a parent of students i know the system was broken long before common core i remember in college my english 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide because i was so deficient on the basicsthough i did well in english all through school i had to take remedial math because my high school didnt prepare me for college coursesthough i graduated with the required credits things have gone down since i was a student and my kids had schools with very high standards but very low expectations that means there were a lot of advanced classes offeredlike calculusbut so many ways to accept failure they had to take history and social studies but only had to pass one the policy of no child left behind was an additional failure as it meant no one failed or was held back even though they wouldnt graduate on time kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted too much government involvement means teachers arent allowed to teach we have some phenomenal teachers who are underpaid with far too much nonteaching responsibility heaped on them schools arent just expected to educate students now theyve got to feed them clothe them teach them manners and how to get along look out for abuse deal with all their special needs and accompanying ieps head off bullying deal with allergies and medical conditions worry about gender identity and sexuality discipline fairly deal with helicopter parents check the boxes for college prep and deal with the everpresent worry over school shootings with all were expecting from schools and teachers its a wonder anyone goes into this profession or stays once they see the outlook common core like no child left behind is a great idea on paper that fails in implementation my kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were welleducated there was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students it meant even more testing for studentsto judge whether their teachers were up to the task at the same time they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do betterlike tenure they promoted the best teachers out of the classroom they took away teaching assistants due to the costs they increased class sizes and they started charter schoolswhich were experimental programs imagine if all those billions spent on common core were used to pay teachers moreand get out of their way,negative

here is my feedback i totally got the eureka moments in every level it will be easier to automatically grab de magnet i got softlocked many times so the restart was nice i dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset initially i thought i should return to the key hub that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic ill love to move while aiming it feels more fluent the key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but i dont know how well it fits in the game the doors werent like the key type so it doesnt make sense to open them with it also its kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character for example making the positive smile and the negative sad the main character could shine more while aiming maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim overall i loved it and am really thankful that it was free for everyone so i could try it ,positive

great video again marko you did a great job  sadly the netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos  in addition i can tell that after the fukushima nuclear incident in march 2011 the eu banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second chernobyl incident the thru regulations coal was stamped as dirty and gas was the second best option after nuclear power if we go back into history the north european countries the netherlands also build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages since there wasnt a need to change and gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created now there is need so the coal and nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need from my point of view these things should change nuclear is the way to go create a military security perimeter around nuclear power plants the western world shouldnt be working with russia nor china for energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability furthermore the ecb cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0 intrest rates the financial unstable countries you call them pigs portugal italy greece spain and with this structural inflation problems russia knows this and the ecb messed up big time last but not least the eu but also the usa canada australia and japan need to stop applying qe start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable thanks again marko,positive

here is the transcript the literature review is not an essay it is not a research paper the literature review is part of your essay the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe standalone product if youre masters degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for but regardless of whether part of the research essay or standalone product one thing the literature review does not do is it doesn’t prove state illustrate collaborate or develop your main point thats in the body of your essay the literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper well what the heck does it do then well the literature review is divided into the following key terms first is the whole idea of what the heck in the literature the literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic now remember i said narrow topic we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic thats the first thing that you need to know the literature is published peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic second thing the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed what the heck of a review well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it what is that snapshot going to capture that snapshot going to capture major concepts the major point the major outcome the major whatever in that source it’s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot once you get all those snapshot done you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of timeline situation maybe not but the key years is you’re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element may be on a time line type of situation now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why theyre hack are you doing all this stuff well i think there are three reasons probably why youre doing all this stuffs in school in the first one off course to improve your own understanding as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding build your background build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline then in of course in this paper when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject youre going to be demonstrating that knowledge demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment but you know the real purpose of a literature review is it’s a reader service it something you doing as a favor for your readers what are you doing you are bringing them up to date what’s the first thing you and that old friend do you ask each other hey what you been doing all these years fill me in update me you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in you updating them by bringing them up to date then you can start at the present again you see what i’m saying you can bring them along that timeline of the path letting them know the key element the major concepts the key element in your life and what you dare boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literatures review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas past scholars the past researchers boom and then come your idea,negative

okay everyone scroll down to see the correct answers for the problem 1 polygon all meshes are made from polygons within games polygons must be 3 sidedtriangles though typically in animation and 3d design polygons are 4 sided 2 code all it needs is code so we can start giving the ball commands on what to do and when 3 3d in almost all scenarios will run slower in comparison almost anything can slow down a game though an 8k 2d image with an intense shadermaterial will put a lot more stress on the game than a normal 3d model,neutral

good summation my only disagreement is with the part where you say investors chose bbby in jan 21 because it was highly shorted my understanding is its part of a basket of stocks all shorted with the same instrument and all retail companies movie theatre used game store towels and when gme went parabolic the covering that occurred on that single security pushed up the whole basket i cant talk for other investors but very little of the rest of the basket was mentioned on reddit prior to the last week of jan 21 sure since becoming bagholders people think its a movement but to start with it was a value play when i went long gme was 918 pre split with 12 book value when i went long bbby it was 498 with huge call option interest at 5 and ryan cohen had skin in the game its fine playing meme stocks but i suggest getting in when the chatter is low and if ryan cohen is involved make sure your cost basis is less than his ,neutral

i agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time i think theres a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about democratization and the experience catch 22 i feel like your video alluded to what i mean by democratization quite well so i think were probably in agreement there a lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow pytorch and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models i think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boilerplate enough that its ripe for automation using some kind of automl the sqllike syntax that redshift and bigquery offer or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away this opens ml models up to the techsavy but nonspecialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and mlops we still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often its just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day for experience i really think theres a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless selfteaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people this is where i think we disagree the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you dont talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience the largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you i would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level my expectation is that youd see a massive gap favoring employers at 02 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5 years of experience so while the industry is expanding the companies arent hiring juniors or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program together i think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals if workers with domain experience but not a ds education can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job i think were going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree,positive

the reason why 1 works isn’t just because of the method but because in the first case you only have one finger the center of mass is always a point and since you’ve only got one point of contact where your finger touches the cane there is effectively a 0 chance the center of mass is exactly on that contact point and thus starts leaning towards one side or another if you use the second method there’s two points of contact and thus as long as the center of mass is inbetween it cannot tilt you can try finding the center of mass on your own with two fingers together without using the special method and just doing it normally and you’ll see it works fine tldr you don’t need a special method to balance on the center of mass you just need two fingers so that there are two contact points for the center of mass to be between,neutral

hi everyone i realized i didnt actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games thats why ethical monetization is my specialty now so for sure theres data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions it also encompasses monetization and systems design though i wasnt formally trained in monetization design before joining its actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first monetization design encompasses things like battle passes loot box designs game ecoystem design hard currency to soft currency what resources are tradable and purchasable etc designing events and seasons what content should be available how is it distributed what does progression and rewards look like in an event etc and ofc the pricing of it all we also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones we often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction purchase regret mau revivals etc to get a sense of this my role today though focuses on a broader list of things not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well i made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out,positive

in my opinion elon brings the hope that we all should have for our future its encouraging in a sometimes discouraging place to be im sure there are many more like him on our planet and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live rather than some who are here for their personal gain and greed not thinking of the future past their own something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world without our approval as a whole and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets letting drugs go rabid people starving including myself at times because the cost of food is out of reach allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you cant afford your own apartment something must be done both at the state government level i have trust in elon he may not have all of the answers nor should he just the fact that truth matters to him more than anything shows that you can get onboard with his ideas and plans for a better future for us all christina,positive

i like the nods to fanboyism in this presentation  i was unlucky that in my college years you generally only had 1 option in it which were basically programming for databases and networking while i specifically went to learn coding and graphics designing to create games i learned the graphics part on my own also because i had a real knack and passion for it coding was more difficult as information to code for gaming or even a gameengine were hard to come by or expensive now almost 2 decades further our country finally is getting a gamingindustry and there are classes you can follow i hope i can start in september and hopefully theyre not too basic as i already have some basics i already tried creating a game twice sort of first time was more than a decade ago supposed to be a fighting game or beatem up i got my character modelled not textured and even rigged for facial animation but i soon realized that coding and balancing a fighting game is really hard to do so much to consider and take into account and there wasnt even a decent free engine that could provide what i needed two years ago i started again but with another genre i liked and more manageable for a single game dev an arcade racer luckily i was able to pick up blender easily where i left of they also made it more userfriendly and found a decent free gameengine godot atleast good enough to give me the taste of gamecreation and create a tiny concept i have some videos on my gamedev channel close call racingon channel eyeemotion i have been on a break from it because of renovations at home which i have to execute myself and im changing to unreal engine since its change in licensing and its more friendly to devs who are more into designing than programming i just need that gamedev 1 year course to get the ball rolling again and keep me motivated when i get stuck and the information i need,neutral

a summary video two water  h2o uses a covalent bond each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen it is thus a polar molecule  all water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity – these are hydrogen bonds between the positive and negative poles of different molecules  hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion and thus high surface tension  cohesion is the attraction between two like things eg two water molecules  water has the highest cohesion of any nonmetallic liquid  adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things eg water and glass  capillary action is water defying gravity  water is the greatest solvents due to its polarity  hydrophilic molecules are polar – their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water  hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are nonpolar  solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily when frozen  water has a very high heat capacity – it is good at holding on to heat thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets,positive

my take probably messed some up 1 the cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form your finger than the heavier side so that finger moves faster towards the com of the cane this causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass 2 the phone is not evenly weighed so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize right well the same effect is observed when spinning a brick it fell on my foot twice while i tested that that i played around with i believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brickphone is in the middle of the whole object so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the com will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum the spin is easier on the other hand spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy so this state is unstable the phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate which is a more stable state rhyme unintended the same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending your hands out which causes you to decelerate 3 this one is a bit of a troll i tested deuterium water and distilled water and the distilled one produced no less effect it’s not the water that is attracted to the cup it’s the stuff in it ions 4 the cereal contains some iron which is magnetic this makes it attracted to the magnet maybe but what is interesting is that water and glass fex are pushed away by magnets it’s diamagnetic anyways maybe the magnet makes like a small cavity in the water that the cereal falls into i did not observe one i do not know but i did manage to destroy a box of good cereal and throw the cereal all over the floor 5 hot air rises as the hot air creates a rising bubble the material the tea bag is made out of slowly burns away when it gets light enough it slowly flies up hope i am correct hand have a nice day edit watched the answers video,neutral

humans are smart but i think we are really learning insight into our abilities when we try to understand what we perceive is the moon there when we dont look at it read about object permanence in psychology for instance there are many other interesting correlations like this which may shed some light on observation we are reaching the limit of being able to discern what is novel with what could be attributed to another already agreed understanding even if the correlation is not obvious even our inherent bias may get in the way and like any puzzle such as a sadoku we may eventually learn that the complex mathematics could be on the wrong track and have to be scrapped only to have to start basically from some previous branch no matter how far back and finally it seems we are fast running out of feasible experiments to confirm or deny the predictions made by quantum mechanics,positive

this movies actually a play on the 1940s film noir style of filmmaking movies like the maltese falcon the big sleep or later on stuff like chinatown about a jaded detective starting what seems like a simple case to pay the bills but quickly spirals into a complex web of competing parties where just when youve got it all figured out a new piece of info puts everything into a totally different light so basically the movie is about how a scenario like that would play out if the detective was an aging hippy with no sense of selfmotivation who is completely unqualified to deal with it at the time it came out people compared it to their previous film fargo which while it had distinctly minnesotan humor it was still a serious truecrime story in the end but comparison the big lebowski is a lot sillier and plays around a lot more with genre while ultimately having a story thats about nothing and people didnt like it it became whats known as a cult classic after it came out on home video when all the couch potatoes gave it a second chance,neutral

excellent repair i few years back i did a repair on a computer with a broken sata port i replaced the port and the system ran fine a year and a half later the same customer comes in saying that his data storage hard drive wasnt working im like okay i asked did he want data recover service he said it was working fine and that i was the last person to touch the computer so it must have been something id done i keep snap shots of before and after repairs of my work and keep a printout with all my work orders i said to him that his system didnt even have an hdd in it when it was repaired and only had one ssd in it he mumbled something and said hed just take his business elsewhere i know the vast majority of people reading this are either in the electronics repair business or are hobbyists but i have a serious question to people whod just be regular customers if you had something repaired a year or more ago and something else went wrong unrelated to the original problem would you seriously bring it back to the repair shop expecting that it would get fixed for free im hoping this question doesnt come out as snarky or sarcastic its a sincere question id like to have answered,neutral

im taking a few online ml tutorials and have a text book not related to the course and i have to say that it is very similar to what i did in econometric with regards to predicting the regression analysis in ml is the same as i did in econometric but i just i didnt use python to do it i was using stata but you could use r to do the same thing and now days im sure they are teaching python in economics at any rate even after taking econometrics and taking a ml course i still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful albeit i do recognize that ml is a large topic and the first part of learning ml that i am doing including the textbook all start off doing regression analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesnt use when they talk about ml and the other parts i have yet to get to like ai and neural networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about idk i often hear people say that ml is used for large datasets like at netflix google amazon or etc to help suggest something or something along those lines well thats all fine and good but i dont work at a company like netflix or google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill the other problem is that to use ml at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ml course that it is very complicated and wont go into thus kind of making the example of these fang companies almost useless in the short term and medium term when you learn about ml you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chartgraph with a line through it eg the trend line technically you could use excel to reproduce some of the things i have learned in ml so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating or other things in ml like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age salary and whether or not they bought a car you can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes 70k will they buy a car it will be based off a percentage of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not the problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes and real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc so it becomes hard to do your own projects in ml because they dont really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects most of the time the ml tutorials focuses on how to do the predicationtrend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using they just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset this is a huge issue if you want to try doing ml on your own data because they dont teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a smallmedium business or say your website has x amount of traffic etc im often left wondering how the ml regression analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter for example in my book they talk about using ml to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 57 factors but to be honest the housing sample is a great example but i often have trouble trying to think of a problem that i could create using ml to predict a result ie my own project also the examples often are intuitive like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be i dont even need data or run ml on it to know that it can get demotiving at times so the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true like predicting gas prices will be higher in the summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacationtravel during summer also they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter its 200 pages like that countless hours of videos from tutorials saying now of course the real life data will not look anything like this but you get the idea i am kind of stuck inbetween smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ml and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what i want im tempted to skip 20 hours or 200 pages ahead and dive into the neural networks but cant stop thinking that maybe regression analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way will be helpful in the ai section or whatever so far its like learning basic statistics but in python,neutral

i am very thankful for this presentation i was afraid i was the only one that was pondering these ideas specifically concerning microbiology specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move in a since chemically that would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light in effect just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving its structure idle at its point of origin but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parents original quality in this accomplishing the quantum speeds said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction as well as color change we see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic plant cells great discussion,positive

i did my undergrad in computer science and im finishing up my ms in computer engineering it always drives me nuts when people ask what i do and then assume either is just programming or software engineering i try to explain it like this computer science is centered around mathematicscomputational science and problem solving developing algorithms and optimization programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems computer engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems i always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took computerelectrical engineering as undergrads because they generally speaking are simply trying to make x thing work and i am trying to make x thing run as efficient as possible you can take several different paths to become a coder but theres very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines anyone looking at going to school for computer science should understand this you are learning to be a problem solver first coding is secondary anyone can learn to code but being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career if you go down this path you are going to be doing far more math than coding and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code you will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts libraries and frameworks but those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use i hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into,negative

this was a lovely event worth it for the acting alone especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of eves awakening i do think the debate was played too much on shakespeares terms and turf in part because prof smith politely allowed it to stay there some thoughts biographical silence favours shakespeare about whom we know relatively little than milton whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss weakness aspiration perseverance hatred and love this was hardly raised so too historical context shakespeare comes clearly out of an elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like marlowe and codeveloped by writers like jonson milton obliterates the norms of mid17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism drama favours interiority and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness milton and most literary history would not have thought it so though the actors brilliantly depicted ms dramatic imagination in paradise lost his goal unlike shakespeares was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind but to go beyond them his theme is not finally the human but the humaninthecosmos in short we judged here whether milton was better according to the criteria of shakespeare shakespeare will win that battle with anyone milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether youre asking the right questions in the first place,positive

here’s a story for you beginners i went into my first class of cse with no knowledge of coding i got a c in intro to java okay yeah i did bad but then i wanted to get better so i did some practice over the winter to improve my logic okay b in the next highest class the following semester software 1 then over the summer i was able to learn so many other languages swift python javascript i had all this growth in a little under a year all i’m saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesn’t know how to code and don’t think it will get easier trust me it gets easier do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like it else’s while for loops etc to help you gain a feel of how they work i would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java as a beginner this is a daunting task for me so over winter break i made projects such as modeling a car in java okay what functions does a car have accelerate decelerate break etc from then i could think of variables okay what could toggle a car being on or off oh a boolean oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero okay that’s loop there with gas level modeled as an int see things like this slowly helped my logic grow and now i can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me trust me i’m still a beginner as well but i ended up catching up to the kids around me when i was once behind and in times when you feel like giving up please don’t i urge you to stick through it because it does get easier,positive

daemon is being made a lot more nuanced than he was in fire and blood the “heir for a day” brothel scene really makes me question him we saw that he’s not enjoying himself at all despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the gold cloaks’ accomplishments with the boys mysaria seems to be an enabling force goading him into his darker tendencies when he says “we must all grieve in our own ways” i think he actually was somewhat saddened by baelon’s and aemma’s death daemon does want power but he does love his brother “over the centuries house targaryen has produced both great men and monsters prince daemon was both in his day there was not a man so admired so beloved and so reviled in all westeros he was made of light and darkness in equal parts to some he was a hero to others the blackest of villains” archmaester gyldayn,negative

what i have gleamed from this is that ill definitely be playing turf war a lot more in this installment the specials look like they actually benefit turf war compared to the previous versions and will definitely be a lot more fun overall in ranked modes i love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered it gives people a chance who normally wouldnt be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them i personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to longranged weapons when your weapon doesnt have the kit to contend definitely a plus seeing brush being able to grapple because in certain do or die situations the brush may be the last line of defense and deserves a chance to shine without constantly having to wait until opponents approach you,positive

i found this very interesting and as someone with adhdi i had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it it brought up so many points of interest with in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution adhd is considered an epidemic of our time and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking from the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses as time went on this idea continued but in a different way by the 1920s there was a drive towards raising the standards of living people were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked and live in the suburbs in a house get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style but like he said in the talk this type of trend doesnt work anymore styles of life are so divergent and its obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women arent going to be stay at home moms and many cant actually during the 60s many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life and as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living as for adhd it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child i believe adhd is both a cause and symptom of behavior but not always both take your eyes for example you get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly so you get prescription lenses you now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription and no one asks why no one asks why are you like this how did it happen or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it yes and no you can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors your nutrition your genetics and your life style actually some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight by changing their diet and their habits for instance a child who stays inside all day watching tv and playing videogames for hours refuses to eat his vegetables and whos parents or relatives have had glasses may develope near sightedness so in relation a child who has been mentally watching tv and playing videogames all day not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity exploring their real world developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating interacting socially with others around them making constant decisions based on logic real feelings and experiences and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner and it doesnt just go for adhd this could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty in varying degrees of course but it is believed that behavior in any form is partially learned and partially developed and by developed i mean the way your brain developed how your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works going back to education you can see why this factory mind set cant work for everyone as well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts you find contradiction most people dont understand the arts most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesnt make sense anymore truth is that area of education evolved but only by those who pursue it would understand a big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world the a grade is the pinacle of that idea do perfectly in your education and you get an a well this doesnt really work in the art world you still get graded when you do your work and do it well but school is for practicing the academics in art you study academics as well like art history art theory and your use of a medium like drawing or painting what you dont get graded on is on the things that cant be measured like your idea your creativity and the value of your work though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill but when it comes right down to it art isnt about any of this or it can be about all of it it can be about how others value your work it can be about how divergent your work seems to be it can be about how well your work matches a subject it can be about how well you use methods of design it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic aka art competition or auction so in a way it is chaotic to the point people cant make sense of it any more but it is not inherently measurable and perfected it is the product of ideas and ideas are valued above all else and yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty,positive

masters union cannot replace institutions like iim or iit because of the sheer fact that mu does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university indian colleges or universities dont have any place in the top institutes of the world and rightly so but something that an iit or iim has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy because of the implementation of reservation there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into iims and iits be lacking in certain core subjects dont assume i am a casteist because i am outlining a drawback in reservation policy i completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who havent had access to great education in their schoolscolleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education but in an institution like masters union going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds who have had access to great education since kindergarten while masters union assures great education institutions like iits and iims ensure social equity and great education the entire para is based on my knowledge that there are no reservations in mu,negative

some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,negative

i would also like to point out that actually understanding machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics as was mentioned as a benefit being part of something will be extremely difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability statistics in fact at my university in order to enrol in the first machine learning course you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus with proofs as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops one or two courses in linear algebra and 2 courses in statistics that’s not to say it’s impossible to use ml without that of course it isn’t however it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge much more so than with required programming knowledge for ml so yes you will be “a part of something” in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with but it’s a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ml publications at a meaningful level or be generating their own custom models,neutral

germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy their co2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence personally i am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer but without the emissions renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclearfossil fuels i would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants using the same small plots of land with renewable it requires covering vast amounts of land with solarwind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is windsolar this land should be used for farming or nature preserves not renewables if the solar is using worthless land such as the desert maybe it makes senses but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaningmaintenance needed due to the dust offshore wind also resolves the land use problem but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties,neutral

pragg continuing to be the comeback king amazing play he made this tournament extremely exciting was just glued to all his games and magnus also played really well at the start but i lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely he couldnt even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested the least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so its not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him rlly left a bitter taste but im soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring,positive

i have a decent amount of physical games from the original xbox 360 and one so i feel justified getting the series x especially because it has superior fps at 4k resolution the problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series x to its limits yet if you still have a one x and plan to get a series x later and can wait you can update the internal hdd to a sdd on the one x it’ll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the series s the one x has a better graphics card than the series s previous games optimized for the one x will look better on the one x than on the series s however cross platform games are probably going to have a better fps than the x do to the better cpu there’s a lot that goes into this stuff another factor to consider is the quality of your tv i’ll be looking to pair my series x with a new oled tv here soon and then i’m 200 sure i’ll feel justified with the purchase also i game a lot so 30 60 120 frames a second… i notice the difference and in no way shape or form would i feel justified having a next gen console series s that can’t even keep up with my old 4k tv,positive

imo something thats extremely underrated especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on observer pattern is a must for game dev with larger projects having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects and it makes your code more modular each classgame object is its own self contained thing singleton and factory patterns as well as solid principles are also good to look into factory less so for unity since you can use getcomponent to retrieve references for things if youre using unity learn to use unity eventsc events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects,positive

i think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself in your death bed every now and then to prepare yourself for this you must read the 9th chapter of the death of ivan ilyich again just a very short chapter where ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed he suddenly hears the voice of his own soul saying what do you want what do you want he says what do i want to live and not to suffer so his inner voice says to live how to live as i used to well and pleasantly as you lived before well and pleasantly here is how tolstoy continues and in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant life but strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant life now seemed at all what they had then seemed none of them except the first recollections of childhood there in childhood there had been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live if it could return but the child who had experienced that happiness existed no longer it was like a reminiscence of somebody else as soon as the period began which had produced the present ivan ilyich all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned into something trivial and often nasty so as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and darker he basically realises that his entire life had been a lie he lived for what the others expected from him for money power and statushe wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no way back indeed we all must keep ivan ilyich in mind every day just consider how fast the time goes by how much of it do we really spend seriously thinking about our lives very little indeed because it requires a certain level of focus and depth which we dont have most of the time thats why this scene is a great reminder so as we make the death bed exercise i have just mentioned we can use the very questions that ivan ilyichs soul was asking him i think people who live well deal with their mortality better so doing this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better thank you for this wonderful lesson i love tolstoy,neutral

theres a lot more unusual stuff under the hood of these guys and their echidna cousins their skeletons for example have epipubic bones aka pouch bones which are only found in marsupials and monotremes but more unusual still they have 3 bones in their pectoral girdle while all other mammals have only two on a human for example the pectoral girdle aka the bones that link the arms to the rest of the skeleton and make up the shoulder is made of two bones the scapula shoulder blade and clavicle collar bone with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum it means that we like all mammals can pivot our shoulders around not just the arms within the socket compare this to birdsreptiles and older tetrapod groups and youll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum this third bone is the coracoid bone and mammals lost it a long time ago except in monotremes on the plus though like the rigid flight frame of a bird it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim or echidna to dig splayed legs more ribs than other mammals low body heat eggs venom etc honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointynosed hedgehog,neutral

very informative video i agree with many of your points and id like to add some of my own im a lead data scientist at an american unicorn 1 we dont really care about your background as long as you can code sql and python understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ml models your education might limit your progress later on but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entrylevel data scientist 2 communication is really important we expect all new hires to be good on the technical side so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high and lowlevel is how well you can understand whats being requested and whats important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business this is the number 1 thing i mention to my reports during 11s 3 many data science courses bas or masters dont teach sql or if they do its just basic stuff regardless of what your actual role as a data scientist will be sql will always be essential,positive

its two different things to start learning and to make your first serious game when you start learning if you go straight away to make your dream game it will likely be frustrating because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game creating a copy or a remake of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn when i started learning unity some years ago after doing a few tutorials i decided i would create a remake of duke nukem 3d using some of the assets of duke nukem forever and remaking the first level of the game in blender this was so that i could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project it took me i believe 6 months to finish it it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game and yes it played terrible and nothing like the original but the amount of learning i did thanks to this learning project was really a lot i dont think i could have learned faster other way another point i would mention is learning to code i think was the most important thing i did when i started making games my game ideas were limited to what i imagined i would be technically capable of implementing after i got a good grasp of coding i feel and i know i could make anything i can imagine given the time to do so,neutral

for the platform game i think the second go was almost perfect if he found a way to obscure his hands and ask a loaded question then it would’ve been foolproof like if he kept a coin and hid it somewhere on his person then asked everyone which hand held the coin that’s not a perfect solution but that’s the kind of question i’m thinking of one where if you choose an obvious answer you know they’re lying and the only one telling the truth would give you a third answer,neutral

the only reason i wanted to learn more about quantum physics is because i was listening to dr tyson’s podcast where he mentioned quantum entanglement and that einstein didn’t think it was a thing calling it “spooky action at a distance” now my brain is a contradiction in terms in that i’m mathematically challenged seriously algebra might as well be sandscript but i understand calculus i’ve never found anyone that explain this to me lol so when dr tyson was explaining quantum entanglement i got the concept but i needed more info like trying to understand how an engine works by looking at the fuel fill and exhaust pipe and i know i’m just some guy but after reading everything i could get my hands on that wasn’t written for phd candidates it dawned on me that this might be our ticket to the stars my physics teacher in hs said that the only natural force that humans can’t manipulate is gravity and we’d have to be able to manipulate it if we ever want to explore other solar systems but excuse my ignorance if we can figure out how to manipulate quantum entanglement we would have the means to sidestep the cosmic speed limit,neutral

i’m an excs and mathstats student who actually just switched his double major to actuarial science and mathsstats the reason being was because i found out that cs is only about 30 programming the rest of it is theory of cs and various other theoretical mathrelated cs courses like advanced algorithms and theory of computation which i’m personally not interested in if you really don’t find a lot of interest in algorithms data structures and theory of cs as viable as it is this major may most probably not be for you if you love programming but don’t find the indepth cs stuff interesting i’d encourage you to instead selfteach programming or go through a coding bootcamp computer programming is only a tool in cs like math is a tool in physics,negative

i always find it interesting that the statement logistic regression is a classification method is repeated so often despite regression being right there in the name like decision trees cart random forest and other similar methods there are both regression and classification versions of the method in a binary outcome problem we model the process as flipping a coin that has a probability p of coming up heads 1 and 1p of coming up tails 0 we can either predict p a continuous value between 0 and 1 or we can predict the outcome itself which is in 01 the former is regression the latter is classification logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff sometimes but not always 05 to predict the outcome many times the probability is more important for example lots of the same type of customer you do not want to assume all of them are 1s when p is estimated to be 06 and sometimes the outcome is more important for example making a decision to approve an application for credit,neutral

house of the dragon is inspired by georges book called fire and blood which tells the story of what was known as one of the most violent wars and power struggles within the game of thrones universe the tragic fight was called the dance of dragons and this event takes place 100 years before daenerys the funny thing about the book is that it is a kind of book within the universe itself thats because the dance of dragons was a historical event and when reading the book as it is written the impression one gets is that any inhabitant of westeros could go to the library and read the same book telling about what led to the dance of the dragons to happen and yes it was just a book that tells about this event and it is already finished so for the series we can expect less seasons than got and a more complete story different from the ending of got that was not written by george since the books still are not finished but all the characters of house of the dragon were created by him as well as the basis of the story although some things can and will have some changes hope i helpedxx,neutral

points that were missed apple arguably has a specific monopoly in the us with smartphones because of imessage not being open with other multiplatform messaging apps this weirdly only applies in the states the rest of the world favours things like whatsapp and facebook messenger both owned by meta which is its own issue thats probably the main defence apple will bring up theyve been in trouble before but dont forget about microsoft windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove this kind of got glossed over but although google play takes the same cut for purchases as apple you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like so they avoid the heat there google play is still the most preferred store on android phones so google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software,neutral

data science is extremely saturated at entry level just ask anybody whos applied for a data science job in the last year moreover data analyst is being rebranded as data scientist because many businesses are realizing they never needed fancy deep learning or advanced statistical models to gain insight into their data but good ole basic analysis achieved the same end at a fraction of the cost if you actually want to work on ai projects these days and not just be a data analyst youll need a phd in computer science also despite having a higher barrier to entry the outlook for data science jobs is worse than that of software engineering because the demand is a lot less compared to software engineering as data science tools continue to be democratized and automated software engineers with basic stats skills will be favored for data roles due to their better coding skills as well as the fact that the job is just an analyst role so no longer requires advanced stats knowledge for the most part,neutral

so theres been some conversations here about my use of the term viking and who it refers to i think its important to start off by saying that these videos arent made for universitylevel history buffs or the like theyre designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams alevels gcses etc since i base my videos where applicable on british teaching standards i think its important to note that that the use of the term viking and scandinavian are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level at the level of a bachelor or masters degree absolutely not that level of historical nuance isnt required here yes the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances but not here these videos arent for indepth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the viking age the people commenting that viking was not used accurately are largely correct however in the context of who this video is for it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities these videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further there are other channels if youd like indepth and dry discussions of terminology anyway i hope you all enjoyed the video,neutral

a voice from cambodia  i came from a state owned school and finished my high school examination with a grade then i enrolled in a state owned university and completed my bachelor degree last month recently i joined a management trainee program to compete with other fresh graduate students in order to earn the top 5 spots to be qualified one of them was a girl that graduated from foreign countries she spent 3 years in singapore and one year in australia and i can see clearly see the difference between us in term of languages skills and knowledge it’s hard to stay being optimist because in reality students from rural areas in my countries don’t even know how to properly use a computer while those in urban areas ace this skill and other multiple skills since they were young to my knowledge one of the possible ways right now is to enrich the english language to the disadvantaged students and also creating high quality educating contents in our own language namely “khmer” ideally i hope those students will obtain the proficiency in english language then study the contents that suit their interests through educational media that vastly available at hand now,neutral

my sons were in chinese public schools until 8th and 9th grade respectively i am french and their mom and chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system until the 6th grade the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work now as bicultural kids they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son from 6th grade onwards the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave bullying by teachers can also occur my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates this 2021 reform only focused on alleviating some financial burden what it didnt do is address some fundamental issues with the system teachers are not incentivized to help weaker students instead they push them out everything is based on 2 tests one in grade 9 and one in grade 12 these tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills even if that has improved a bit system should be reformed to take equivalent of gpa into account this would ease a lot of the pressure the last 5 years of high school are spent on passing 2 exams rather than help students grow there is a little that is learnt in those 5 years to help them transition to higher education yes most of them will have strong language and math skills but a lot of it is mechanical some families were using tutors to develop the analytical side of things so at least the ministry should also have reformed part of the curriculum,neutral

lets look at this from a consumer point of view paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing no big deal thats just how the business is obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console but for sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially bribe multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay full price on there platform instead because they know they cant compete with it is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get and they have the nerve to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry  talk about the pot calling the kettle black  sony has no answer to gamepass there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they cant go anywhere else this is simply sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from cod but i guarantee if sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldnt leave cod multiplatform its apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for sony  hypocrisy at its best,negative

after the foul taste the original got left in my mouth i didnt have very high hopes for this yet i watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons maybe not quite there yet but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it i find it hard to pinpoint daemon on the one hand he wants to show strength the city watch part but then hes also arrogant the tournament claiming victory while the fight wasnt over and straight up horrible heir for a day but on the other hand he really cares for rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her her father would need him more now than ever before which shows he also cares for viserys i think him calling viserys weak was his blunt way of telling viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king which is in line with what he did with the city watch he feels like the king should show his strength viserys seems like hes held things together for those 9 years but this clearly is coming to an end i feel like hes made a huge mistake by alienating daemon this wont make things easy for rhaenyra who already has to fight the fact that some people dont want a woman on the throne in the end i think it will be between those two and viserys will be long gone from the picture,negative

i would like to argue that declaring you quit the death game and that the girlfriend can save herself is perhaps the worst way to test the game master in that situation yes figuring out a way to determine why the game master is helping you is a good idea but if the only reason theyre helping you is because theyre impressed with your selflessnesswillingness to risk your life to save hersthey have a connection to the girlfriend then say goodbye to your main advantage in this game im not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declarationaction but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own motivations to see if that has any effect but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you,neutral

i was gratified enticed by dr susskind’s implication of the time ‘shear’ near the event horizoneh because it supports questions i have been asking for years about the structure of a black hole which is commonly dismissed as “an unexplainable singularity at the center of the eh” that i have long believed is nonsensical without mention of relative rates of time layering i note that feynmans qed is not actually sensible explanatory or even rational but only exquisitely descriptive this vid also illuminated for me the ubiquitous ‘hairiness’ of the universe as a thick tangle of erepr entanglement ‘filaments’ stretched in at least 4d by an infinitude of time sheared partners i think this makes the universe a relatively big but very tiny place,neutral

im from india and here students can get admission to all the big universities only through an entrance exam due to covid the exams were postponed in april which is the usual time they happen now when the country has hit peak infection the central government has decided to hold all the exams at least 30 million students attempt these exams each year despite the clamour from the students and opposition the government is proceeding with it students have a long list of various concerns that are brushed aside 1 due to the rains many regions are flooded families displaced and property destroyed 2 transportation is nearly impossible some states have still not lifted the lockdown so trains buses and taxis are either unavailable or charge exorbitant rates 3 the exam centres are few and far between particularly in the rural areas without means of transportation students are unable to reach the exam centres even if they do manage to arrange for transport as hotels and restaurants are closed or open only for takeout they cannot find safe accomodation 4 many of the students have applied to multiple universities offering same or similar programs they all have entrance exams in september if a student tests positive due to any of these exams either he cannot take the exam or he infects hundreds of others when he attempts the paper despite the illness and like always the poor and disadvantaged in the country are suffering the most in this situation the government has offered no explanation or assurances for safety this is a no win situation for both students and their families the government has no solution that affects millions of students education and career other than to postpone the exam or hold the exam this is the state of education in india right now due to an incompetent government,neutral

nuclear is a great carbonfree base load electricity source i’d like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio on the downside nuclear is expensive to build and insure but the actual watts generated are among the cheapest there are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors and it seems like we’ll have enough of it for 50100 years if we generate 4050 of the energy from nuclear on top of that thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors 4th gen which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run making initial investment lower they would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid,neutral

it would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16” model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz not great but i would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you’re viewing movies it sucks that apple has made that limitation but is that a limitation on the thunderbolt or soc  i feel that the argument that many people don’t use a dual monitor setup is not really true especially in the work place my sister uses dual monitors working from home and she uses one of those miniwork towers the thing that tempts me the most about the air is the weight portability and the amount of power given specific specs it’s more or less wellrounded however if i’m bumping up the storage and unified memory i wouldn’t be that far off from the m1 pro 14” macbook pro price strangely the 14” would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13” nonretina macbook pro  the only cool thing about that model is the upgradability but even that is a novelty that’s losing it’s veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to i’m hanging onto it as my backup computer really ought to start saving for a more uptodate laptop the smudging thing is annoying from what i see it’s an awesome color but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all besides the size portability and power not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that i’ve yet to experience at work i work with desktop towers and i’m used to the noise i suppose,negative

great discussion thank you yuval said early in his talk that we should look to our governments to ensure that the youth of today receive the kind of education they need to survive in the future i would suggest that national politicians are likely to be the future useless people my government in africa has done nothing to help the people all it has done is line the pockets of the politicians education is already being reengineered today by the private sector udacity coursera come to mind there are huge changes taking place through these and other similar organisations and their association with universities around the world so the future of the youth of today depends on them thomas friedman in his book thank you for being late suggests that the previous digital divide between the educated and the lesser educated has gone and the new divide is the motivational divide the youth of today need to be intrinsically motivated and overcome the natural laziness that yuval tells us about and learn and keep learning what they need to know is what to learn then learn it with the help of the internet organisations like udacity khan academy coursera and coaches and mentors teachers in the world of yesterday schools also need to embrace these changes,neutral

first got into btc back in 2016 and have been hodlingbuying assets at different price points since ive been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play i dont have any alts as im a bit of a btc maxi but that said if btc hasnt died before it surely wont do so now stick in there yes we are all feeling the pain but over the long run this will just be a blip this is how i see past corrections when i felt that i got in at a high back then i think it was less than 1000 and bouncing all over the place now when i look back all i see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times but if you believe btc has value then by all means buy the dips if you can afford to for those who got in at 60 or 70k and feeling the crunch hang in there btc is not a get rich quick scheme wait it out and you will see you will come away stronger i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over 11 btc with 31btc in just 5weeks from day trading with wtrade inspects in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,neutral
