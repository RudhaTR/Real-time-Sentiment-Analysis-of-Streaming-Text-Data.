this video made me a bit sad made me realise how the industry has changed and not for the better i have young children so can’t game like i used to but when i do have time i find myself increasingly drawn back to older games that i’ve played before but adore the vast majority of new games just don’t appeal to me as for the new gen consoles…what’s the point all they seem to be doing is rereleasing older gen games yawn,negative

i honestly think marques should start a gaming channel only so we can appreciate him enjoying his tech in the way most people will do being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticisingwhich to be fair no one with sense would think he doesnt enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition,positive

1442 this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses this ones just different the game was over lol its not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown the game is literally over all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and thats it the washington wizards were up by 3 at that point even if the apposing team has time to foul you you hit just 1 free throw and its over even if you miss both they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to tie the game in an impossible amount of time long story short that throw lost them the game after ot lol just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history,negative

very entertaining one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected i remember my wife was given a free ticket to a diamondbacks game which went zerozero so she finally left and when she came home she said i got bored with the game the diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left winning the game i teased her endlessly after that suggesting she should not attend more dbacks games and they went on to win the world series that year my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the yankees and luis gonzalez base hit that won the game i met joe montana and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl and i saw the ending in french in montreal in 90 during my flight from sfo to toronto and the connecting flight to montreal our air canada pilot gave us updates on a onesided blowout i also will never forget the stanfordcal game in 82 and the play when cal beat stanford and the band became part of the game some still argue over two of the lateral passes but the win for cal was as it was and i still say that is among the craziest moments in sports history my own crazy moment was when i was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team even though i was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team the school we played had no players above the sixth grade so i agreed we won the game though i had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game adrenalin had me psyched and our qb said i threw perfect spirals i would intimidate the bigger players since they feared id plow under them and stop them from getting to the qb and they never did he was not sacked our team went on to win the norcal championship undefeated in our twelve team league my brother playing as wide receiver though i no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders i never went on to play in high school feeling i was too small to be as good as i was in my grammar school game where i also played on the defense and i stuck to distance cycling and golf both of which i enjoyed and also had many crazy moments and i was decent at the 440 as it was then now the 400 meters even in my early 60s now and despite a leg i broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago i still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing on my channel here cactus521 i even have a video of me jumping off the vegas stratosphere tower when i was 52 though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered i felt peace and not fear on the way down choosing that vs skydiving as my free fall bucket list item since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane ,positive

thanks for the update i always appreciate the insight im really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long i had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video in as much i would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end if this is really a bear market rally then bitcoin is not done going down just like stocks are not done going down and if this isn’t a bear market rally and the fed achieves a soft landing bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now but we just have to wait and see my hope is that by the fourth quarter the economy will be slowing enough that the fed says we are going to pause and then you will see the next crypto cycle start i have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed imo please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions despite the volatility that has ruled the market this year being a retail trader in the crypto market and implementing strategiessignals from eddie crypto a professional brokertradr that has been my mentor i have accumulated 12 btc in profits although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits people who are open to learning from history will survive it’s not that difficult you can reach out to mr eddie on ͳeiєɠɾαm his personal handle is edcrypto8 or whatsapp✙18053284321‬,positive

my grandfather actually played with bobby regularly in 1956 at the west orange chess club in new jersey they played on the same team in interstate tournaments i found some of my grandpa’s old letters and it’s pretty cool he won multiple chess championships some amateur and some professional in the late 40s and early 50s he also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines he was born in 1909 and while i like to think he taught bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year it’s likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa my grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially chess tournaments didn’t pay well back then though he probably played teenage bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future if a 13 year old made a multitime champion quit the game entirely he must have been truly special my grandpa could card count so i don’t think he had a problem switching to bridge and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career i never got to meet him because he died before i was born i’m only 23 i would’ve loved to ask him about bobby maybe my mom knows a bit more all i have are letters and a few chess trophies it’s very hard to collect information from the early 50s,positive

im just looking forward to finally the notch being gone ill believe it when i see it as far as usb c is concerned theyre gonna keep lightning as long as they possibly can and then eventually end up removing the port entirely maybe with the standard iphone models theyll put usb c only because theyre forced to at that point and the pros will have an advanced magsafe as the primary solution instead of a regular port,positive

i just got the series 7 two weeks ago so passing on the 8 interesting idea on body temperature if they made one for diabetics where you tested glucose a feature to weigh you and blood pressure……you may never need your doctor  not sure if i would want a larger watch i have the 41mm series 7 and that looks “normal” on my wrist since i have small hands and wrist anything bigger and i might as well strap a tablet to my wrist there always are trends to make devices bigger then when that’s bulky smaller returns i would just like longed battery life,neutral

100 the most stable beta i’ve ever done on an apple product think this is going to be one of the smoothest releases ever my biggest complaint is the ui for a lot of logins in safari not sure what it is but it just looks ugly and like stuff doesn’t fit right i’m sure there is some kind of setting i can tweak but love the weather lock screen and matching wallpaper if looks really clean the layout of settings is a lot better also even though inevitably when they rearrange settings it takes a while to find everything but it is much more intuitively than previous “improvements”,positive

i think they keep home button models because kids and older people actually like it better its so much more simple to do a button press than remember 19 swipe gestures,positive
keeping the bezels and home button on the base ipad is a bit of a dick move by apple but predictable i was hoping it would just get the current ipad air design and that the ipad air got closer to the pro with the full 11 rather than the 109 at this point they should just rename it ipad se keeping this in mind the next iphone se may even get the body from the iphone mini a single camera at the back but keep the bezels and home button… oh no…,neutral
the base ipad is the perfect tool for studying its literally all i need to complement my mbp cant remember the last time i ever used a headphone jack in any device but why oh why does the ipad need a camera bump plz apple just a solid flat tablet is all we need i will never use the camera in a base ipad and the bump ruins an otherwise clean design,negative

i love the camera bump as a guy who loves luxury this just adds another luxurious look to the iphone along with those protruding camera bumps samsung is copying it jt can’t be bad  most importantly it means higher quality cameras and durability with thickness its the best selling phone in the world right now for a reason aesthetics do matter a lot anyone complaining well there are other options except you know they use less premium materials than apple currently,positive

the question of ai sentience is in some regards unimportant a large percentage of humans recognize the sentience of nonhuman animals yet inflict on them terrible suffering for no good reason why would we treat an electronic creation with more respect,negative
what scares me is that the lambda ai said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool and cf narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool the reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for our gain only and only to use it as a tool but humans being expansionist by nature and training the ai on our own speech and texts it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the ai slowly but surely i hope the ai deems it ethically right to work along side its creators and expand in coop in the future when it does become senteint not only this but once the ai becomes selfaware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the ai and who gets to use it and for what because ai is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly,negative

i think its safe to say that before trusting in systems like google maps one must research the routes those systems suggest you take before going on your adventure especially if those routes are longer than the comfort zone of your own city for example before i go on a long drive to a destination i have never been to before i always check the routes on google maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one its unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did so its a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory like my husbands parents they always have a large jug of water in their car along with a weeks worth of rations first aid kit blankets flares etc even though they rarely go off the beaten path,neutral

i’m a guy i listened to this interview while doing bicep curls in my basement after playing rock on the drums i’m a right leaning guy politically as well i loved this interview i often feel the urge to reject feminism because i feel attacked by the most extreme people that instead of wanting men in the conversation exclude them but emma’s approach to feminism is bringing guys in to the conversation to learn new lessons and recognize biases they didn’t know they had conversation and compromise are the two things that hold democracy together when neither side is willing to listen or compromise nothing is achieved when i say compromise i don’t mean women or men not achieving full equality i mean that conversation is not possible without appealing to the other side when one person yells at another the other person stops listening and is just getting ready to yell back thank you emma for being a voice of reason and compassion,neutral
semra im a long time real madrid fan and your analysis of casmiros game is probably the best ive heard in 10 years both of his strenghts and the areas one might call weaknesses it was perfect and i would add that both zidane and ancellotti held him in the same high regard i hope we dont live to regret losing him too soon we need you on main stream tv more,positive
i agree with the sermas comments regarding casemiros age but this whole 30 is the new 25 is very subjective and depends on the player luckily casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats his injury record is phenomenal as well however not every player ages like casemiro modric ronaldo etc some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire 1 or 2 years after 30 so whereas its objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way that doesnt mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it some dont even have the opportunity to do so players like eden hazard sergio busquets are good examples of the counternarrative in my opinion on his goals casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the oppositions box is very good great aerial ability as well all in all real should be glad that they didnt lose him without tchouameni already recruited good luck tank,neutral

an interesting footnote from history after the conference in tehran in 1943 it was decided that the allies would start delivering aid to the yugoslav partisans and that aid to the yugoslav monarchists would be stopped when after the conference one of the british members of the delegation told churchill that he had sold yugoslavia to the communists churchill asked him will you live in yugoslavia after the war the delegate replied that he wouldnt to which churchill added i wont either so why bother,neutral
one small thing that perhaps was worth talking about you dont mention the percentages agreement between churchill and stalin this dictated the amount of geopolitical influence the soviets and the british had over greece in the postwar period which defined greece as chiefly british in influence that lead to greek communist pleas to moscow falling on deaf ears that contributed to a divide in the kke whether to be titoist or stalinist which was important to understand their aims and how that inhibited the movement great video as always,neutral

i really liked what you said around 325 about analysis being in retrospect recently i read the iliad a book that i had given up once before and which i knew near to nothing about i skipped the introduction which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it i was initially constrained by the idea that it was a difficult book but over time with some paced reading i found myself really curious about what would happen next i knew of course that i was doing a light reading of an overly analyzed book and that i would miss a lot of detail but i still enjoyed it and after finishing it i went back to read the introduction and found it incredible since it made me think critically about things i had read or notice stuff i missed as a bonus it also gave me desire to read it again youve earned a new subscriber from portugal looking forward to more videos,positive
you are so right the first reading is to get the idea and enjoy the book but if you stop there you never know what the book is really about not unless its a drugstore romance of course i fell absolutely in love with prousts writing luckily i can read french and reread my favorite passages in their original language thats when all the light bulbs went on i didnt realize it had as many plays on words in it he has so many clues to the theme that you dont see in english you just have to read things until you get them and like you i would say that three readings is just about right thanks for another great video,positive

tip always start with reviews you can mix up their themes maybe one review didnt do this but the other didsee whats been strongly estbalished thru time and check if theyve mentioned controversial parts or gaps of your topic from this check recent past five yearjournals about these gaps and where do they stand also literature review is quite overwhelming at first given the large amount of information youre gonna see especially for the younger generation given their access to scihub which can put you in a psychological rut not just to comfort you but also as a professional tip— you dont need to write everything you know or everything about the topic coherence and transition that will support why your doing a specific study is more important moreover sufficient if you see an underlying pattern in terms of method or conclusion lets say among 35 studies try to explain this pattern in 1 paragraph you dont need to write how those authors got the results in detail unless you see a clash between two papers then maybe you can reevaluate their differences in method,neutral

magical realism is not from colombia because the term is european in concoction however when european writers viewed the way latin american writers wrote they saw it as realism with a splash of magical they viewed these stories through a lens of exotification without realising that its all real and that its a description of the absurdities found in latin american societies if we think about what exotification is its about seeing whats mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it its very much about ignorance and how what we dont understand can often appear magical as a result how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered this is why magical realism in my opinion does not exist its a term created in ignorance and perhaps the literary term itself is the most magical part about the whole genre,neutral
excellent explanation i completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against eurocentrism but i think its scope is even bigger one aspect of magic realism is politically ideological that is the postcolonial stuff another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialisticscientific determinism this aspect is more philosophical and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical ie it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes this is just my personal opinion,positive

the thing that was not mentioned in the video is that there are two mcdonalds in india north and east zone run by connaught foods and south and west run by hardcastle foods the menus for both of them are different meaning each of them have their own exclusives i think nikhil was having the south and west mcdonalds they have a bigger menu compared to north and east indian laws donot allow foreign companies to hold 100 of business in india they are required to partner up with a local company so mcdonalds partners with connaught foods and hardcastle foods dominos with jubilant foods yum brands partner with devyani international sapphire foods and more recently burman hospitality starbucks with tata coffees etc so the local companies do get a say in the menus which is why the menus may be different at different places in india,neutral
what nikhil says from 2300 is absolutely right it might seem its cheap to the foreign viewers but in reality it is actually quite expensive for the indian population,neutral

educational institutions usually leads to an enrichment of ideas and a chance to gain an upper hand in terms of either gaining higher degrees or being more effective in your current job though there is inequality in terms of learning acquisition neighborhood preconceptions of people and income which affects how much of the education will actually be grasped by the pupil student it’s fascinating seeing how societies construct various institutions for the given populace to work around in loved the references you used as well james,positive

so we found that the problem wasn’t the education system per se but the circumstances that children grew up in and rather than even entertain the possibility that an inequitable socioeconomic foundation was to blame it was easier to say “kids aren’t learning because there’s something wrong with the books teachers and schools” i love how simple it is to explain so many crappy circumstances through the lens of cognitive dissonance now we’ve graduated to blaming lack of homeownership on people being too indebted as opposed to a dearth of housing options in the places where people actually want to live or more accurately a dearth of places with housing where people actually want to live,negative

my god this actually gives me an understanding of why there are so many international students from china who board at my school especially students in my year year 12 to get an education which is actually constructive and without the burden of social status being dictated by marks etc ill have to replay this video when ever i start to complain about my education being hard because it is nothing compared to this,neutral
the problem i have with those overly stressful education systems is that i wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them what i learned through selfdefense practice and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus and are not an effective way to learn in selfdefense instructors increase stress by making you do cardiobased exercises to make your body artificially feel stress accelerated heartbeat difficulty to breath difficulty to focus only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal but they dont do it for learning purposes the military seems to do it too in their own way i would also point out that every doctor in the world with common sense would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue its funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stressfree education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months i wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries here in france we dont have that type of education system nor in the united kingdom i studied for 2 years at a british university,negative

i certainly remember being much better at being creative when i was younger but now that im a freshman in high school ive noticed that im much worse at the whole creativity thing now the problem is im being praised why i am great at finding the one answer i can take tests very well but am typically not the best at projects math is my best subject english is my worst where you typically have to write creative essays i want to be an engineer so at my school we have an elective called preengineering its one of the closest classes to an actual job thats available at my school and im not the best at it sure i can do the math required but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard i feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future its telling me that theres one answer which is never the case in engineering i hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul and realize that we need to change education,negative
i now have a whole new appreciation for having learned history at school and having had some great teachers and lecturers once i got to university with history theres never only one true answer for every question you ask because everyone views the world differently from culture to culture religion to religion even between generations which is why history gets revised so much to answer the questions that each era asks youre free to come up with any ideas of your own so long as you have the evidence to back it up,positive

i find this so awesome i hope these colleges are forced to significantly drop their prices they sucked american students dry crippled an entire generation of millennials from being homeowners and ever building financial security now its finally coming to a head and its long overdue i hope students find great jobs and stay out of debt,positive
this was inevitable university tuition kept skyrocketing over the past 20 years tuition has greatly outpaced both inflation and incomes for collegeaged students the entire millennial generation became de facto indentured servants from their college debt basically financial slaves to their debt education can be very useful for employment goals but there are limits and we are approaching that limit from a cost to value perspective generation z is not stupid and they are declining to voluntarily set themselves up for a lifetime of paying back student debt trust me gen z you do not want to find yourself in that situation it will steal years if not decades from your life and you will never get that time back also most skills of the high demand and lucrative software engineering tech jobs are not taught in college but rather can be learned just as easily by anyone with a cheap internet connection and sufficient motovationfocus its common for software developers to earn 6 figure salaries with no college at all companies do not care where you went to school or even of you went they only care if you have the skills that can help solve their business problems how you go about acquiring those skills is totally irrelevant the company doesnt care if you learned to program java at college or on your own its high time that universities start to feel the sting to their annual profits as more 17 and 18 year olds wake up and push back on the cost of attending college,neutral

thank you for the info im a brazilian student struggling if its worth applying to the us i did a indepth research some “mock” sat’s at home and have a strong sympathy for certain american colleges education structure as compared to brazilian or european universities which im fortunate to have the citizenship in both places nevertheless if i do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years i’d have to eliminate one of my options whether usp in brazil or epfl in switzerland due to the amount of time set into both while balancing my studies for the local admissions testfuvestusp the epfl’s entrance exams in french and a few ec’s i obtained a couple of 1550 scores at home following all the procedures as timemonitored tests i judge my english as nearfluent since i have been taking classes since i was 9 above all i have a strong passion for physics mathematics and technologiesmainly ai related to physics research i also would be prone to take sat ii and possibly ap exams as well as the toefl to sum up with my 96 out of 10 gpa my main concern involves my financial background and my lack of extracurriculars related to my major of interest math or physics with computer science i have participated weekly in two educational nfos since i was in middle school and more recently online with administrative work some calls and at the end of the pandemic as a teacher which i loved i had acoustic guitar lessons in the same period mentioned until i started piano lessons one year ago i have been taking english and french private lessons for 4 years and played varsity statelevel soccer being the captain until the pandemic started i acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live i life i wont regret however i awfully believe that my extracurriculars arent good enough for top 20 schools and im inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education but entirely different from what ive expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that i also have in history and art back to my financial means im entirely grateful for the opportunities that i already have and a possible new pursuit would be limited to an investment of 25000 per year from my parents by converting my mother’s income to usd35000 we would qualify for 100 financial support from needbased universities and those would be my goals my question is am i a strong applicant for america’s a1 universities undergrad or have i lost my chance by not investing in a passion project,positive

i love speculative biology but this project has one problem as i see it the idea is presented that these amphibians wouldnt transition to forms of exothermic metabolism we have evidence that both crocodilians and dinosaurs could change from warmblooded to coldblooded and back again birds being warmblooded reptiles show the transition from ectothermic to exothermic lifestyles why wouldnt amphibians do the same over the eons in one shape or another,neutral
an animal evolving a foamlike cover instead of fur is such an interesting and original concept goddamn now imagine if those foam glands slowly made the foam more firm over millions of years the glands adapt eventually the foam glands evolve into something similar to hair follicles that produce very soft bulbs of keratin we now have frog sheep made of cloud bubbles this sounds like such an adorable fairy tale but also oddly possible in real life,positive
one thing about the inhabitated lodge given its a desert animal i think it would make more sense if its tadpoles inhabit its back a protected reservoir seems tl be good for tadpoles in a water poor enviroment and given how beecomb frogs already carry their eggstadpoles in chambers of there belly this would feel like a nice nod to this real animal in addition this could be a way to get mammalian or placentalian amphibians of sorts if it would continue to evolve along this line,positive

some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,negative

why recreate adversity im definitely part of that subgroup against bonsai its crippling trees for just aesthetics and theres also some weird control issues to unpack around it just get some plants that are good for your local wildlife,negative
people like to talk about torturing trees like they dont cut their grass every week,negative
so a bonsai could theoretically become a normal huge tree when planted elsewhere but the question is is a tree “happier” when it grows way bigger or is the tree happy when it’s small too the obvious answer is no the tree doesn’t care another answer would be “we have no way of knowing” people like to assign emotions to things but a lot of the time those emotions are just selfreflection people assign the wrong emotions to animals too even though we know animals can feel emotion people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly this happens all the time so even when we find out trees can experience emotion and some evidence already suggests this we would probably still force our own perspective onto them like we do now what we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do with the conditions they are given are they “satisfied” being the tree that they are i don’t think trees know this concept i think people shouldn’t anthromorphise their idea of “succes and satisfaction” onto plants in fact people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don’t need it the trees definitely don’t need it either,negative

nice to see that kants take on epistemology that our knowledge of reality can be defined only as phenomenal or relating to our experiences senses and how our mind organizes information as opposed to noumenal or relating to fundamentally direct knowledge about reality itself still seems to be floating on gracefully for anything dealing with the actual nature of reality time to visit your local metaphysician unfortunately any statement from a metaphysician can only really be speculation and language games so alas,neutral

the trouble with the holographic notion is pov point of view on the one hand and photon density on the other …… then if we had three or more hands all of the substance that can’t be “projected” and of course light speed having said that i do agree that all of the forces are actually expressions of the same phenomenon that being the interaction of matter energy with the higgs field at the plank scale to my thinking this interaction elevates the energy level of the field proportional to the interacting mass and this is gravity the energy level of which creates the effect of the curvature of space so that is another effect that cannot be projected as a hologram,neutral

it really depends on whether you are studying at a college or a university how theoretical it gets i just completed my bachelors of computer science at a university and basically programming is not being taught to you just very very minimally you are expected to do learn it yourself on your own and everyone does so anyways it is more a tool that you use for other courses than what you are learning towards i had a lot of theoretical courses in maths theoretical computer science complexity theory technical computer science transistors and stuff and practical computer science algorithms and datastructures you can use your programming skills everywhere to solve tasks and that is the beauty of it,neutral

computer science gives you a language to communicate your technical ideas as well as a framework and tools to evaluate them and while you can learn programmingdevelopment by watching a bunch of youtube videos if you lack the basic cs knowledge you will always struggle to make technical choices come up with a poorsuboptimal design while this is understandable that for some people the cs curriculum means a lot of depth which it certainly is it has big rewards on your software engineering job once you learn it well it is easy to supplement knowledge related to the latest trending technology but if you have knowledge gaps in your fundamentals youre gonna have a hard time overcoming those,positive

right when i got into my first cs class in college i was expecting to learn a bunch of programming languages but in reality we just learnt only the concepts and wrote a 10 line program in c for two days and never did any other programming that first cs class made me hate cs because the material was way too quick i started reading the first 3 chapters while taking detailed notes of every paragraph and then it got too overwhelming since i was spending nearly 10 hours for each chapter just taking notes each week i didn’t have enough time so i stopped reading the textbook all together and started to hate it because i was just memorizing the concepts without actually understanding their uses i understood how they worked but not at all their applications my advice read the textbook briefly and don’t read every word so that you won’t become overwhelmed and stop reading all together,negative
i dont have a computer but it seems very helpful so i hope soon to get one   i like how it teaches you about it so fascinating,positive
pretty good summary i disagree with the statement that it isnt a science however cs researchers routinely make falsifiable claims about the real world and then test those claims through experiments in fact thats how im spending my winter holiday like if i solve this problem with method x instead of method y i get a more reliable answer of course if you only have empirical evidence ie its been tested in the real world your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof so in that way it might be that some problems cs folks tackle are scientific empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics but some big popular branches of cs like machine learning and ai advance primarily through empirical rather than mathematic evidence whether mathematics itself is a science i will leave to the writers of dictionaries,neutral
if you want to motivate people for your subject your goal should not be to show them how simple it is but instead how deep it is,positive

i was a computer science major but i switched to computer engineering last year there really isnt much programming after your first 3 semesters in cs after that its all theory which is great for the few that want to work in academia computer engineering actually allows me to apply my learned programming skills to projects whether inside or outside of class this is why i made the switch and have no regrets,positive
currently a bio major on a pre med track covid had me rethinking my career choices this past year and now looking at switching to computer science this was some really good insight thank you,positive
here is my story i’m currently thirteen years old and have been programming for a year i started off with the basics of c for a few months then i moved on to python i’m currently a python intermediate and now i started learning java i think what kept me going was practicing and building my own projects i was fascinated by the cool games and projects i can create and that made programming even more enjoyable to me i would also recommend finding a coding partner or a coding club as suggested in this video because you can help each other out and build projects together i personally wasn’t able to find a coding partner of a coding club since not many kids my age know how to code,positive
hey man i just started my computer science journey at ucf about a month ago and i was wondering if you ever found a specific time during the day or night where you find yourself to be the most efficient with coding in other words do you have a time during the day where you just shut everything down and force yourself to just stop programming for the day or is it usually different for you every day i loved this video i really related to feeling pretty lost my first 2 weeks as i had no programming experience at all but am finally really starting to get the hang of things my professor for my intro to c class has been constantly repeating that 80 of the learning in this class will be outside of the classroom and i have found that to be some real truth,positive
went through all of these during my first year at university i know it may seem complicated here or really difficult but it honestly isnt if you want to study cs or computer engineering or something like this dont let this keep you from doing that dont be afraid by thinking its going to be too difficult or whatever i promise its not,neutral

programming can be incredibly creative and selfexpressive its just not taught this way in most colleges unfortunately like its unlocking the full power of a computer so you can make it do literally whatever you want also problem solving requires a lot of creativity and lateral thinking generally,positive

so my university currently has both software engineering and computer science both majors are pretty much the same thing and the only difference is about 3 or 4 classes for example for the data structures and algorithms course there is cis 350 theory based and cis 3501 se side of the class also the core requirements has se majors take se 2 after se 1 while cs majors only take se 1 so its really the same degree same requirements only difference is a couple of classes that are very similar,neutral

the reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard it is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before remembering a few equations like dates in history class nor by just scrapping by office hours are the key to succeess yes but even more important than that you must complete all homework when due and dont ever give up on a single problem then you must practice practice don’t study only practice that way you don’t just know you have complete understanding about concepts much like pointing out a particular color in the room you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing like identifying red letters s t o p means stop how to approach the problem and what equation formula etc to use tools in a toolbox baby,negative

fire emblem became one of nintendo’s larger series thanks to the 3ds i don’t really play fates or sov anymore but i still find myself revisiting awakening love that game if you can step outside of your completionist mindset you’d probably love it,positive
smash on 3ds was a marvel in its own right the fact the 3ds could handle it and at 60fps on the og 3ds was absolutely mind blowing to me for the time,positive
i’ll always love splatoon they never take away things that people have always liked and instead they either make it better or add on things we’ve wanted i’m just really obsessed because i’ve always loved this game since i was little,positive

thank you for explaining that turf war is the casual mode in splatoon it seems silly but so many people judge the entire game on that mode alone,neutral
as a oled switch owner i have to say that it’s a great list but i’d include switch sports and mario party superstars in the honorable mentions those are the type of games that makes the nintendo switch be different than any other consoles in the market the local multiplayer of this little thing called nintendo switch is nasty,negative
as a person who lived through the dark ages of the wii u im so glad nintendo is back making so cool games for us since the switch released,positive
this looks a lot better than the version they showed last year smooth framerate fastpaced action and over the top silliness welcome back bayonetta ,positive
guys if we can see how cool bayonetta looks with her new summons and moves imagine jeanne i can’t wait to see the difference hoping that jeanne is playable and maybe even with her actual voice actor also i’m really loving the new bg music in the first scene it’s such a bayonetta genre of music,positive
bayonetta is gorgeous and her style with lady butterfly and her armor is too dopehope that the combat gets some more content besides the trailerim thinking that some nuances and combat systems will show up ingame wellgotta rack up some cash to get this one day one 3,positive
the problem is its not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the mario kart tracks for example they need to upgrade their ux and put it in the switch online section of the os and also message it better my guess when i saw this was that they can see loads of people arent taking advantage of downloading dlc as part of their sub,negative

perfectly said i’ve been bringing up stuff like this for years and i absolutely despise this double standard you can love their games all you want i certainly do but nintendo as a company is seriously one of the worst in the industry stop discounting everything they do just because you have good memories of them this needs to be fixed not just at nintendo but everywhere,negative
congratulations rgt you’re finally learning what trends are it seems nintendo hasn’t trended negatively like activision has so their opinions haven’t been altered,positive

personally i’d much rather a free carrying case then fancy unnecessary packaging i appreciate a company that’s forgo paying the extra bucks on packaging and placing it into something more functional to the consumer in the long run,positive
the steam deck is an excellent friendly competitor nintendos advantage is many great first ip and tons of third parties not to mention name recognition but the stream deck could make nintendo focus on creating a nintendo switch pro or nintendo switch 2 that has more power which i think is great because it puts more pressure on nintendo to do better,positive
i think fancy premium packaging would be cool but i like the fact that they are trying to be less wasteful in comparison to other businesses,positive
while the steam decks performance handling these aaa games is impressive id really like to see more content creators focus on other aspects the steam deck is a fantastic way for first timers to try pc gaming and it really has so much more to offer where i feel it really shines is the extensive catalog of lesser known smaller and past titles basically pick any random old game and it will likely allow settings comparable to the rereleaseremaster releases that you have to wait for and pay extra on console older games often look much better on smaller screens too so many should be fantastic on that little thing,positive
one of my favorite uses for my steam deck was loading emudeck and having the virtual console ive always wished the switch would be,positive
i think its a time of wait and see imo were seeing all these investments because interest rates are low if at the end of the process sony for example dont see financial gain i can easily see it reverting were all hoping this works as gamers but none of us know what the end result will be,neutral

super happy about the pretty substantial single player games coming out not into online social multiplayer games at all so this was very much welcomed,positive
great presentation love the actual gameplay footage and variety of games very grateful for game pass love this service,positive
i disagree console exclusives is what separates the companies and hardware apart if exclusive games are a thing of the past then their is no need for a playstation xbox or switch everyone will become a pc gamer in a perfect world sony microsoft nintendo will join forces and sony will engineer the hardware with microsoft’s wallet and ambition for higher specs and nintendo’s passion for innovation unfortunately we don’t live in such a world,neutral
if all games were on one console that would eliminate competition and create a monopoly,neutral
i have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives i get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform this coming phil along xboxs track record concerning their exclusives since around 2013 and up havent exactly been praised as playstations have been this is more corporate weasel words xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises halo gears of war umim sure im forgetting some others the line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption xbox has doing really well with game pass but they are missing that killer app for the system,negative

ive owned both and the series s has a special place in my heart i love the x but unless youre rocking a tv that supports 4k120 w vrr the series s is just fine also its so tiny and its amazing what a quiet beast it is but definitely buy the storage expansion card regardless of which one you buy,positive
the series s is plain amazing especially with gamepass and if you are into backward compatibility gaming ive just completed the entire gears series on 360 because i never got to play them back in the day gears 1 to judgment and its been a pure blast you can also find an online list of all the games who received an fps boost including xbox and xbox 360 games so theres that too some are now locked at 60 and some are even at 120 fps yes my last name is spencer how did you know,positive
the only next gen console i could find was this one have owned it for about a year 0 regrets would buy it again its amazing its form factor blows my mind so tiny but so powerful,positive
i definitely have no complaints with the series s from what ive seen 1440 is still more than adequate for graphics and it runs super smooth and is still a very quick console,positive
when the first xbox came out it had some awesome games on it a decent amount of games as it evolved games started fading for the system it gained way more power etc each time but lacked games with each update lol now we have the ultimate series x microsoft figured since there’s no games for the system for real they gave it the ability to play pc games as well,positive

my 1st console was the original ps loved it so much that i stayed with them and upgraded to ps2 somewhere in there i picked up a used xbox because my 1st lan party with halo just blew me away then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what i was willing to spend at that time so i turned to nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems getting the xbox series x was an easy decision for me i have nintendo switch for my exclusives strategy and rpg needs while the xbox satisfied my craving for fps and games that required higher processing and graphical power,positive
something to keep in mind i had to replace the thermal past and pads because the home screens of most games were enough to make it over heat and power off,neutral
i hope there will be more games hitting 120fps at at least 1440p if not with the series x then definately release a pro midgen refresh asap,positive
a pro version of the xbox and playstation is something that isnt needed they are still making cross generation games leading into the end of 2022 and possibly 2023 if there is going to be a refresh it may not be until 2025 or 2026,neutral
i think game pass will have 35 million subscribers at the end of next year all the game releases and activisionblizzard games in game pass will surely add alot to it,positive

capping for higher priced games is like saying youre happy to pay more at the pump because the want to support the people working at the refinery,neutral
i’m very happy with my series s and i’ve been all about physical media before i got it i do plan on getting a series x eventually but i’ve just been playing digital games on my xbox one most of the time because of game pass ultimate after thinking about it i realized my physical library on xbone was substantially smaller than my ps4 library or switch library so i didn’t really feel bad about getting the series s and an external hard drive even though my 360 library was pretty big i’ve been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like 3 each digitally when the series x becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper i’ll get one but for now i’m really enjoying my series s,positive
i went from a one s to the series x and the jump to 4k 60fps is pretty significant everything feels much smoother and everything loads faster thank god for ssds the only issue is that there arent really any games out right now designed specifically for the series x with the exception of the medium aha,positive
i’ve had my series x for a week and i’m still in love with it the visuals and overall gameplay of the games are amazing i can’t stop playing microsoft flight sim because of how beautiful it looks and how well the console runs the game strongly recommend if your an xbox fan,positive
bro there is a charging port on the xbox ,neutral

the part at 500 explains it clearly this is why i have such a huge problem with sony right now the sense of entitlement and pettiness coming from them is infuriating seems like this is all about gamepass and other moves by ms changing the industry and now sony is upset because they have to compete on more even ground and are resentful about it,negative

half of this applies to the xbox one already some is cool and new though,positive
the fact they managed to get lies of p into game pass day one is nuts at this point xbox can damn near get any 3rd party game into game pass,positive
microsoft is helping developers financially to get their games finished and out to millions of people sony is not doing that at all and people are clocking on to it and shifting to xbox especially when cod is on game pass every time a new one comes out,neutral

i think the implementation of fsr 20 and the evolution of upscaling technologies will enable the series s to stay relevant the third pearly thing is a concert but i think it’s more of a problem with games made for the previous systems ie ace combat 7,neutral
i have a pc with a 3060 in it i have a nintendo switch and i have a series s i have never had an issue with how the series s runs games because my xbox is mostly for game pass and games that run perfectly fine on the console like nba 2k optimizations for new console generations take quite some time and im patient and it is not a new issue the ps4 had its issues the xbox one x had its issues they were fixed people complaining should calm down,positive
these next gen consoles shouldve shipped with more storage to begin with especially considering theyre backwards compatible with last gen but atleast xbox lets you connect more then 1 storage device if you dont mind moving games id suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive like the sandisk ultra fit you can easily fit 2 on the back usb ports on the xbox giving up to 1tb of more storage while still having room the expandable sdd too plus you can play the older xbox one games off the flashdrive sure you can do the same thing with a normal harddrive however using an ultra small flashdrive takes up no extra space meaning its easier to fit in an entertainment center plus it makes it easier if you move your console often,positive
quick resume is a god tier feature pc my main platform but damn the quick resume on my series s is something else brilliant for getting in quick games before work when youve not got much time,positive
props to microsoft they are truly killing it this generation hopefully sony will step up their game instead of slacking behind the entire time or even better drop their exclusives on pc day 1 with another subscription,positive

i have a 22 ultra i use for emulation and cloud gamingstreaming my series x with wifi 6 and controller plugged in fh5 has been very very playable compared to even a few months ago and i’ve had a blast on the go with rpgs like kh3 etc it’s so very close we are almost there guys,positive
thanks to everyone who sent me this topic and for liking the video 3,positive
they hurt xbox lol from where im sitting it looks like xbox is landing repeated lightning screw uppercuts on sony lately but maybe im wrong,neutral
i understand if you pay for exclusive games on your platform then it should not be on your competitor subscription service but blocking 3rd party multi platform games is shitty,negative
its quite obvious to me that sony fears microsoft thats why they keep blocking games from going to xbox what the heck is wrong with a game coming out to all consoles so that everyone can play grow up sony and mind your own business model and not what someone else is doing,negative
my favorite xbox series accessorie is the pdp media remote ive had it for about 6 months and its great especially for the price got it for 10 on sale on amazon and they are i think 20 or 25 now worth every penny unlike the series 2 i bought its a great controller as well scince they have fixed some of the reliability issues in the newer ones however the price is still to much if your lucky like i was you can find one refurbished for 150 if thats a risk your willing to take buying refurbished,positive
its pretty ridiculous that microsoft is looking towards upgrading systems especially with it being hard to get the new consoles now neither company should be focused on pro consoles until the series x and ps5 have been out and have reached their full potential,negative
i feel you on the cost of the pro series controller i have one of the series 1 pro controllers which i bought used and frankly i was disappointed that after i had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel i had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there because xbox doesnt offer their own replacement parts which i find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue to be honest i would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isnt going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time the paddles are nice and all but i can buy like 3 games for the cost or i can buy a third party controller from scrub for less and get the same functionality out of it but hey to each their own what i would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab i would pay extra for that but as it stands right now ill stick with my standard series x controller ,negative
im beginning to lean more and more towards the opinion that the initiative was always going to be partnering up with a bigger more experienced studio from the getgo maybe they had plans to do this originally with certain affinity as its been confirmed that massive support studio was working with the initiative from the earliest days most likely on a prototype but it looks like gallagher went with his old studio crystal dynamics and this was the final straw that caused the schism with a number of the earlier initiative hires but is it really that surprising the initiative wasnt hiring hundreds of devs every year to scale up for a massive aaa project they were hiring like a dozen employees per year instead and even jeff grubb once succinctly put it perfect dark was never going to be made by the initiative pretty sure gallagher and other highups knew if they were going to make an aaa game they were always going to need a large experienced studio to take on most of the workload trying to get that done with a 6575 person team isnt realistic,neutral
if an elite series 3 controller is on the horizon microsoft really needs to focus on quality control i went through 3 series 2 controllers before giving up and getting a refund i experienced faulty paddles loose buzzing rumble motors and worst of all large deadzones on the analog sticks i really wanted to love it but i couldnt warrant spending that kind of money on a controller with basic functionality issues,negative
matthew first of all you done a great job with your videos love them all have you seen the recent job offers by bioware the next dragon age seem in a big trouble and i think it will be great to know your opinion best regards from catalonia,positive

un trailer siempre tiene que intentar verse épico para llamar la atención y que la serie prometa ser vista por muchos pero muchas veces el trailer resulta mejor que toda la serie y no termina siendo lo que uno esperaba por lo que se ve en el trailer va a ser una serie con 90 probelmas de una chica adolescente como por ejemplo problemas amorosos y 10 de cosas de súperhéroes ojalá no sea así,neutral

that fact before and janet tells him that he should write a book about it shrugging it off the avenger retorts “you’re all welcome for all not being dust” voice over narration from kang the conqueror begins youre an interesting man scott lang youve lost a lot of time but time isnt what you think its not a straight line this dialogue is played as the heroes stand in a lab around some kind of device

great video you did great explaining this that said i would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps specifically data acquisition and cleaning mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research furthermore it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found do some field work say nsf or an ffrdc gives you 2 million dollars for it go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don’t figure out until your back oh well this seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies all the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned the first two steps acquisition and cleaning are so important,positive

thanks for sharing your experiences the manager who spoke of wanted applied scientists a category i wasnt aware of before this video was odd to me so he was saying that there wasnt enough data science related work for a full time hire or else he wouldnt be wanting someone who could also serve as a software engineer i can imagine companies having this need smaller companies in particular where individuals have to wear multiple hats but if i were a data scientist trying to get hired as a data scientist id avoid this managercompany i actually left a job in the 90s for this reasoni was being pulled into other jobstasks that werent related to machine learning so i left and joined a company i could do machine learning full time im an old guy i predated data science so in that time it was called data mining or pattern recognition and yes im using machine learning and data science interchangeably even though i know they arent fully interchangeable the manager is keyeven if you like the company if you dont respect or are respected by your manager it will be an awful job remember that when you are being interviewed you are also interviewing them,neutral

if you want a role where you want to work only with ai and heavy duty programming go for a machine learning engineer job if you want to do statistics and sometimes classic ml and analyze data go for a data scientist job working as a ml engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code so its more se from one side you use python for model development and cjava for production the role is building ai products so you are all day reviewing extracting and preprocessing data to then training ml models evaluate them and match required kpis in the other hand data scientists positions offer what is described in the video statistics and data preparation engineering and classic ml there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have for example in ml engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes i have been in both my background is in statistics and i have been working as ml engineer in computer vision in the automotive industry for the last 3 years personally i can say ml engineering is more fun even more in start ups where you feel you bring a lot of value with your ideas about crazy ai methods,neutral

i absolutely agree with your comments about statistics and i loveownhave read the same book cover to cover there is now a 2nd edition with python implementation btw reason i am leaving comment is to hear your thought about the actual interview questions i recently went through google data scientist interview 1 hour tech screen and to my surprise the question was straight out coin flip probability and expectation problem i was really surprised because the question is very much contrived and i couldnt come up with the answer very easily at first that was the only question some resume related question before that of course i got in the session as a data scientist myself those type of questions are really hit or miss and personally i dont think itd help to measure ones understanding of stats or technical background how would you suggest prepare those,positive

i come from indie to aaa studio as game programmer if theres something to add every discipline has it own depths on knowledge perfecting stuff like design pattern design principle code conventions cicd pipeline automate test etc for programmers is needed when your project grow that come along as other department maybe at the first time you think you wont need dedicated project manager that handling all daily task and scrum but when project get larger team gets bigger you will need that one and for indie who grow to bigger company usually overwhelmed with this kind of situation heck if you love making games later on you wont even touch the project as too many things on managerial you will handle on if you just started game dev make sure that one day what you want to become is pretty clear will you create your own studio or work for big companies which discipline what studio this can be matter as a programmer artist who need align their technology artstyle there so much to prepare and i cant write all of those question in one post hope everyone who read this post can consider your journey even harder not make you scared of gamedev but thinking more critically because this could be your future work and huge part of your life,neutral

most of what youre talking about here is called abstraction despecifying capabilities in order to make them generic and reusable as well as linking related settings and configurations to minimize the effort required to make further changes its a core tenet of software development and my primary concern when designing application enhancements for my job id much rather spend the extra time up front designing something that not only solves the current issue but also related past issues as well as potential future ones in the end if done well it significantly reduces overall complexity while skyrocketing maintainability its also a puzzle that i tend to take as personal challenges,neutral
as a game developer i have always taken the boring stuff incredibly seriously if you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire games campaign or whatever else in fact and i discovered this the same way you did mark by building that framework often times you will accidentally end up building an mvp or demo at the same time i did this as well im still working on my first game but just recently i started closing in on the final lines of code for my unreal engine 5 framework that i will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off as in when im not the only employee well im working on my framework and i look at the level ive built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added and i realized i basically just built a prealpha demo for my game all i need is to make the level actually look good because my level design skills are awful and i basically now have a prealpha project its funny how that can happen sometimes either way i always take this stuff seriously frameworks are everything in my opinion having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it,neutral

i discovered this project literally a few hours ago and now just minutes ago you upload a video discussing launch i have missed so much but i’m very much looking forward to release,positive
10308 since we are talking about mines i wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines now i understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines which i love because they leave a large impact on the world but it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often that is why i thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future there could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is far later into development you could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts the way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks a major issue with this though is how the camera system would work i could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however i feel like that might not fit the game i wouldnt have an issue with it but others may of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldnt work when trying to make mineshafts i think edit i guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground another thing i thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground i say that as if it is easy when i actually know hardly anything about game development but i do believe that should be achievable but going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldnt which i think would be cool of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse,neutral
amazing how much history and experience goes into what looks like a relatively simple game you make it look so easy but it’s so much more than meets the eye,positive
i just want to appreciate the amount of effort youve put into making actual projects i often find myself just fiddling around with ideas in my head and not making any project myself i feel that has been a limiting factor in my learning but this video has been super inspirational i have been wanting to make my own devlog series but i was not able to stick to a project long enough till now i have been wanting to make devlogs and work on a small project for a timeline of 3 months and just finish a full game any tips to just stick to it,positive
ive been struggling to get anywhere with my project im glad you havent given up and i love the asthetic and ideas you have for your current project dont give up,positive
your progress over the years is astounding this new game youve been working on looks amazing and is just the sort of game i would love to play i hope you keep at it,positive
 making a game watch this next how to design fun games  join our discord over 200 game developers  like the video to tell me you want a part 2,neutral
a friend recommended this video to me to inspire me to work harder on my course in level 3 games design from level 2 i figured itd be quite easy but damn i was mistaken this video has fully inspired me to push more and research more of my course so thank you for this 1 year journey it was very inspiring and keep it up,positive
as a person who is still in school knows no coding language other than html and css very interested in game design favourite game being sea of thieves just mindblowing,positive
already 2 years of putting everything together it looks like a proper game good job,positive
i look forward to more game dev content,positive
you give great tips and info that are worth so much more than the time you spend making them please keep up the great work and we will all keep watching,positive
the first game is wonder and so well polished imagine if it was released in 90s it wouldve wiped the market,positive
the first game is awesome the second one just did what you wanted him to but nothing more the third one was quite cool but a bit boring also is horror game material the fourth game looked like if it was made by a 10 year old but still cool,positive
shaders were super intimidating but i spent a weekend learning them and am so glad i did it i feel pretty fluent in them not even a week later and have been using them nonstop i needed to use them for one effect but the applications where shaders are useful keep appearing it’s definitely a tool worth having in your arsenal and like visual scripting vs actual coding being able to write your own shaders allows you to do performance things you wouldn’t be able to do with visual scripting a shader,positive
ive watched this video a bunch of times it really is so good only just realised i wasnt subbed,positive
cant wait for the 2 cent competition though realistically that would be too expensive,neutral
i think the post processing added a lot of style to game made me realise the importance of post processing nice job great video,positive
yoo this is actually a good game just gave it a try the concept is great,positive
you had me at i have anxiety to the point where i almost didnt go in even when i was sitting in the parking lot man do i know that feeling now try it with shortterm amnesia,negative
as a gamedev who uses construct 3 this is really inspiring,positive
this is lovely to hear how you found a whole community and amazing that you spent so long persistently making stuff especially over a year of daily art i just discovered core but didn’t realise it’s a creation tool i haven’t loaded it up yet and they described it more as an arcade full of games i’ve had an idea for a cat game for ages since i got three kittens last year and they’re hilarious i don’t suppose there’s a basic cat model to edit i draw and paint some but the oomph goes too easily i just got back into gaming after a while and you saying ‘i was a bored artist’ resonated i’ve been wanting to do more with characters i was writing a story for too heck i even learned code a few years ago but my passion for websites waned and i found i didn’t love battling all my errors enough to keep going so this all seems fun ,positive
hello i have been tremendously enjoying your devblog videos i can’t wait to see the next i do have a question how are you creating your buildings within your world i just started creating my own top down game with tilemaps and have encountered numerous issues creating buildings with tilemaps i noticed that in the beginning of this video you are making buildings with the tiles that looks like a different program are you having better success utilizing that method of creating your world,positive
cool  i hope you can do this full time someday,positive
this motivates me,positive
coding is what got me through the lockdownlockdownskeeps the mind constantly occupied,positive
not gonna lie i had tears in my eyes what a wonderful story subscribed,positive
im in the position starting out in film as well im very excited to embark on the game dev journey,positive
these were lessons i had to learn the hard way over my four years of development thanks for getting this crucial tips out there for people starting out,positive
a big tip i have to give programmers is to avoid micro optimizations as a coder its generally very easy for me to sometimes fall into a pitfall of seeing a piece of my code and trying to optimize it into oblivion if you have fun then power to you coding is a hobby after all but if youre just doing it to save those precious 2ms its not worth it by any means you can do so much better stuff with your time than spending a couple hours optimizing a system for a negligible boost in efficiency,neutral
507 never ever do this if boolean false is horrible form if an exclamation mark is really too difficult then just use the not keyword but please dont abuse comparison operators like that,negative
start your free trial on gamemaker studio 2 here thank you guys for watching the video,positive
the third game would have been a lot more interesting with one change the platforms are hexagons much smaller and with several more of them on screen at once so that youre always in danger of falling into a hole and not exactly sure where the path is going furthermore after reading several other comments i agree about crediting the developers however everyone needs to realise that the prices were agreed upon before development and the prices were integral to the experiment if the developers were not ok with the amounts they were paid then they wouldnt have accepted the job,neutral
you are very underrated your editing and game development skills are amazing when i watched ur video i have not looked at ur sub count and ii honestly though o was watching a channel that had over 100k subs if u keep this up you will get to 1 million subs in no time,positive
you really know how to edit and create games hope you continue youtube you are very under rated,positive
hahaha great stuff i lost it when you coded coroutine for the enemy death instead of doing it properly which is not that hard such a nice workaround good job d,positive

thomas is back to the old content i’m overwhelmed with nostalgia ,positive
the fact you even thought the robot saw himself as the hero for fighting pollution is really mesmerizing probably a kind of game id be interested if released on steam great evolution in your projects btw,positive
great job accomplishing so much when you were so young its great to see how many different genres you tried too would love to see what you are working on currently,positive
damn you were one hell of a 14 year old developer,negative
dude its amazing how much you were able to balance so many things in your daily life i envy it,positive
once again amazing stuff i’m proud and confident to say that i’m here before you blow up well edited well paced and well shot even with a meh camera i know you’re going to succeed keep at it,positive
this was super refreshing to watch thanks for this i work in retail and i’m currently working on a fighter and i recently got all 6 of my characters working i’m glad game dev is just fun for you cheers,positive
yo this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was so i feel like i should clear a few things up first off to game devs who are just starting out dont attempt to do exactly what i did because it probably wont work out well and im not saying this because i think im smarter or better at game dev than you in all honesty im pretty average and tons of people couldve done a lot better in my shoes but thats just the thing not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that i had prior to this id been making 2d games and was quite familiar with coding so carrying that over to unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple i mentioned this in the video but ive seen too many comments in the vein of wow this was impressive i would never be able to do this which frankly makes me feel a little bad since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience i had and i dont want to discourage anyone who doesnt realize this so i just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2d games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions also everyone learns at their own pace in their own way and the rate at which that gets done doesnt really matter as long as youre able to learn what you needed to learn in the end within reason of course if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print hello world then we might have a problem so even if you have as much experience as i did there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time because ultimately it doesnt really matter how quickly youre able to learn how to make games as a game developer you develop games and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about not how quickly you can make them of course this mostly only applies if youre doing this as a hobby and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay you should probably worry a little more and on the other side of the spectrum to those who think this video was faked it wasnt lol as mentioned before i already knew how to make 2d games and how to program things arguably the hardest part of developing games because of that the focus of this video wasnt on that but rather applying what i knew to 3d games by learning 3d modelling animation and how to work with unity which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such but mostly this was just for shits and giggles since i find messing around with 3d games entertaining and i feel like people may be reading into it too much lol also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar but that was caused by how i usually record clips while video editing and not when im actually making the games so i just have a weird workflow and last thing to youtube why the fuck does this have 500000 views did the algorithm break i can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500000 views and this is definitely not one of them so if youre watching this go watch someone elses video or something this one has way too many views already,negative
such a great and relevant session each of the panelists had a ton of valuable insights to offer thank you,positive
i love these calm relaxing devlogs keep it up dd,positive
your videos are such a treat to watch always excited when a new one is posted keep up the good work the game is really coming along nicely,positive
idea you could have the pathways act as ‘barriers’ making it harder or impossible for weeds to spread thus giving you a reason to separate farm plots and giving the path tiles a function,neutral

hey just wondering did you use the default sessions for the multiplayer or some other plugin would be handy to know because the default sessions i think are only lan and loopback and ive tried that steam plugin but that doesnt work out great also good video,negative
go to and use code hmw to get 15 off clickups massive unlimited plan for a year start reclaiming your time for less than 5 a month hurry offer ends soon,positive
microtransactions are really soiling the gaming experience imo everything is quickly becoming a subscription,negative
the reason triple aaa games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design theyre treating what were supposed to be enjoyable games as engine demos and not giving enough time to release them properly you cant just create another gta v every single year that shit takes a lot of time,negative
another issue is that whenever you sink that much money into a single project the designers have to give up a significant amount of creative control business just wont allow that much money to be spent on an experiment everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey uncreative bland games that look really nice,negative
ive been telling my friends this for the past couple years we are going to see fewer aaa games because games not only have to compete with other new releases but all of the preexisting games as well there is just so much competition in this industry,negative
it’s awful sad to see how stuff goes to thrash when the general public gets access look at youtube itself with its mandatory “ad friendly content” social media taking over everything lack of variety due to companies milking “winning formulas” dry game companies noticing that the casual player is not demanding quality at all… it sucks,negative
glad to have found your channel this gives me a lot of insight im kinda feeling the i dont even like animating thing right now and wondering wtf else i can put those skills towards,neutral
i hope one day to be able to look back at your progress as greatly as you have been able super hyped for the release,positive
super happy to see how far you’ve come being your friend getting to come over and see your progress has always been so much fun can’t wait to keep seeing your progress,positive
good video wouldnt agree with the title though since well hes one of the most popular indie devs out there with an audience of over 3 million on youtube and the 2 free games he put on steam being orders of magnitude bigger than even successful games but hey titles are titles it didnt really get driven on particularly much in the video,positive
awesome way to beat procrastination d im barely even keeping a todo list with my current project i have a list with 5 tasks 3 are done lol hopefully this will inspire me to be more organized because it will speed up my development 200 youve inspired me as always reece and ive only been awake 15 mins d,positive

babe quick milkmansteve just uploaded,neutral
sword have the sword be static on his back or in a side holster then animating attacks that way possibly do both gun floating revolver controlled via mouse shoot with left click and can do a charged shot with right click going this route could make the game too easy though sword and gun do a side holster sword as mentioned above and have a revolver mentioned above that charges with the damage done to the boss edit remember i am smooth brained so may not be good ideas,neutral
when you cant find a game that has everything you want you make it yourself lol,neutral

the one thing i think you really missed here in the raster editing section is krita which is especially useful for creating tiling textures as well as having a really powerful painting workflow,positive
really well put together video loved the editing as always and i feel that the topic you picked up on today is one that not many people do touch upon but is incredibly essential i know ive been developing games for over 3 years now and over one year with unity really important topic and you grabbed it and gave a perfect video as always good job ps almost to 30k,positive
this looks awesome man i love your idea of being able to make your base mobile and fly your terrain designs and creatures are also very cool keep up the good work and thanks for the video,positive
i love how transparent and motivating you are keep it up im supporting u ,positive
a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well you can recolor it 5 different times to milk it as much as possible im very exited to see this games future so good luck,positive
suggestion maybe instead of giving away the locations of the hiders after a period why not force to hiders to make monkey noises instead,neutral

scenario 1 facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs explanation it is supervised learning here facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person therefore the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labeled data it is supervised learning scenario 2 recommending new songs based on someone’s past music choices explanation it is supervised learning the model is training a classifier on preexisting labels genres of songs this is what netflix pandora and spotify do all the time they collect the songsmovies that you like already evaluate the features based on your likesdislikes and then recommend new moviessongs based on similar features scenario 3 analyze bank data for suspiciouslooking transactions and flag the fraud transactions explanation it is unsupervised learning in this case the suspicious transactions are not defined hence there are no labels of fraud and not fraud the model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as fraud,neutral

this is a great video something i enjoyed was the background not too much to get distracted by and you had a good presentation,positive
hello i am not yet an ml enthusiast but clicked on the video because of the slight curiosity i have about it but the nozero days mention makes sense is a good reminder that such consistency is important for achieving ones goals,positive
i have just started to look into ml and learn more about it and this video is an absolute motivator thanks subscribed,positive
i think math is important because if you are trying to solve a problem with ml you need to at least or have an idea of what each mathematical conceptformula are going to solve and perfect for your problem,positive
this was such a great refresher course everything i needed to recollect and on point great job and thank you 5,positive
short and crisp overview of deep learning with cool intuitions this is the only video that i will recommend to anyone who wants to start with deep learning and even machine learning in general,positive
as a comp sci student i find it interesting how you explained this but rather than “teaching” i would more describe it as “evolution” you know like only the strongest or most fit for whatever task survive till the next generation just like in real life birds might not know why they fly south only that they do so every year same with the bots and their tasks i think explaining this way at least for me is easier because bots don’t “learn” they evolve through the generations,neutral
i am a 12thgrade student and really interested in machine learning i did some basic math which is required in machine learning and am starting with this course today i really liked the fact that the language which is used in this course is python so excited to learn about this new branch will try my best to complete it thank you stanford for uploading these lectures,positive
thanks a lot for describing such a big comprehensive ai information in such a way that i can easily see and understand the forest of ai especially machine learning,positive
better than lots of courses on udemy i really like your humor,positive
notes for myself def of bias the inability for a machine learning method to capture the true relationship is called bias def of variance the difference in fits between data sets is called variance,neutral
i have watched many of joshs videos several times whenever i find myself trying to remember a concept i know that a statquest video will sort me out in 10 minutes or less,neutral

just loved your content love the effort you put in every single video like its just wow keep creating the good content love,positive
dissapointed you did not animate a 13000dimensional graph would make things easier,negative
unlike most teachers of subjects like this this gentleman seems to be genuinely concerned that his audience understands him and he makes a concerted and highly successful effort to convey the ideas in a cogent digestible and stimulating form,positive
i just sat through a 3 day ml accelerator class and you series did a far better job at explaining them with 4 twenty minute videos well done mate really appreciate it thank you,positive
hands down i have never seen anyone explain mathematics so beautifully the way he does kudos,positive
1 supervised learning 2 unsupervised learning 3reinforcement learning,neutral
this is great please make advance course of ml and make some good projects like spam etc,positive
best channel i have ever seen,positive
got a question on the topic please share it in the comment section below and our experts will answer it for you for edureka python machine learning course curriculum visit our website,neutral
would love for a full series on how can we use rl to control real world dynamical systems,positive
this sweet spot between control theory and machine learning definitely interests me especially applied to astrodynamical systems please continue making these videos professor brunton,positive
first option b the weighted sum of the inputs is calculated second option a the bias is added third option d the result is fed to an activation function lastly option c specific neuron is activated,neutral
quiz sequence is b weighted sum of inputs is calculated a bias is added d the result is fed to activation function c specific neuron is activated,neutral
order badc working of a neural network the weighted sum of the input is calculated the bias is added the result is fet to an activation function specific neuron is activated nice video it helped me to learn deep learning in 5 minutes,positive
do you want to learn technology from me check for my affordable video courses,neutral
thank you so much for your presentation i have learned a lot exercise test size02 c1 kernelpoly accuracy 9917,positive
the hard part about machine learning is not the how but the what i can plot learning curves very easily but reading them is another story thats why i like to focus my ml videos on the concepts rather than the code chances are that the code is doable in two lines but if you cant understand the output or why your data might give you certain kinds of output youre wasting time and resources,neutral
good interview but as someone who has already know the concept of data science and machine learning im actually interested to know what are the differences between a data scientist and a ml engineer hope this question will be answered in a future video,positive
thank you clement we need more interviews with ml engineers in your channel,positive
i really hope ryan starts a machine learning podcast or something its something i can pay for,positive
hi i have a question i am currently doing a master in mathematics with a focus on ml and statistics but mostly theoretical how could i transition to becoming an ml engineer is it enough to learn how to implement these models in python or is there something else,neutral
hey this video really made me catch my understanding of what is machine learning is i referred to tons of different videos i am able to understand kind of but not meaningfully but this video gave me the complete meaning of machine learning to understand deep practically,positive
amazing explanation i loved the way you taught ,positive
sir i have a question as the r square adjusted always decreases with the increase in predictors how can we be sure that it is not ignoring features that are actually correlated,neutral
excellent 1st session excited to do the 2nd part tomorrow i am trying to revise my ml knowledge to get back to competing in kaggle,positive
excellent resource sir can you please explain all the sub fields in ai ml dl like nlp computer vision etc any other major part that i dont know even in software engineering we have specialized paths for different types of engineers like for web development frontend technologies are same html css js for backend one may choose a programming language php node js aspnet and a database again for mobile developers they may choose android ios or cross platform react native flutter with database knowledge apis basic knowledge on how web works my question is in software engineering one may become a very good software engineer even he only concentrates on web or mobile dev can an ai ml engineer pick his career in his filed of specialization like only nlp engineer knows very less about computer vision or computer vision engineer knows very less about nlp,positive
hey there firstly i cant thank you enough for starting this channel  im here after i saw your video about how to pick up the basic skills to become a data analyst in 3 months video and want to let you know that i had started the google data analytics course on coursera about 45 days ago and have finished 2 courses in the certificate series do you think it is possible for me to pick up the same skills you mentioned in your video through this course do you think the google badge on the certificate might give it an edge i honestly feel the pathway you described in your video takes a more in depth approach which might be beneficial would really really love to hear your thoughts on this it would really mean a lot if you replied thank you,positive
thanks for your time and effort the way you have designed and presented is awesome you made many peoples life easier thanks again,positive
im a data scientist and 95 of my job is data collection and preparation its still a cool job but its not all model development,positive
at first i thought i will learn machine learning in 6 months with some coding experience i dedicated 5 hours on normal day and 10 hours a day on weekends to study the field and make it in 6 months and guess what in reality it took me 1 year of hard working and studying this field to be able to build deploy deep learning models and to only begin comprehending state of the art models and begin to mix different algorithms to solve a specific problem time may vary from person to other but real hard work and dedication is required if i was to go back and change the way i learned things rather than just jumping to the field first to learn data structures and algorithms programming logic then try to learn and apply some basic algorithms like binary search reverse linked list string manipulation this will help you so much to improve coding skills the first step will help you so much in processing data solving problems related to data and getting your models to work using your own way second learn some basic calculus and statistics linear algebra probability dot product gradient descent third learn machine learning algorithms and try to apply them using your programming skills,neutral

as a genxer i enjoyed this interview so much it made me actually feel like i was experiencing the internet we were promised decades ago a well thought out and intelligent conversation that in the end leaves the viewer in a state better than when they first pressed the play button well done,positive
great introduction question is it always the case that humans need to input the potential features that are used for classification for instance the ml algorithm uses the animals height length and face size as features for classification with computer vision being used to map images to these features do some ml algorithms create these features and features maps automatically or are these always created outside of the algorithm ps what did you use to create this video it looks great,positive
ai is already here and that is not such a bad thing can computers become self aware yes i think so in the not too distant future,positive
well explanation love it,positive
hey daniel just discovered your channel a couple days ago and im learning lots thank you,positive
